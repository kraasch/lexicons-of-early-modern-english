# Lexicons of Early Modern English

The LEME was published as one of many lexicons on [Lexicons of Early Modern English](https://utoronto.scholaris.ca/collections/10df91bc-8c9e-4ce1-b291-f02ad5715538) at the University of Toronto as learning material under permissive license (see below).

The idea is to provide easy access for text processing, especially the [plaintexts](./page/plainText/).
