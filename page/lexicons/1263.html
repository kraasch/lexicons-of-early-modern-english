          sample: <!-- HTML_TAG_START -->THE fyrst is to know what thing Chirurgerie is. Heerein I doo note the saying of <i>Lamfranke</i>, whereas he sayth, Al thinges that man would knowe, may be knowen by one of these three thinges: That is to say, by his name, or by his working, or els by his very being and shewing of his owne properties. So then it followeth that in the same manner we may know what Chirurgerie is by three thinges. First by his name, as thus, The Interpreters write, that Surgerie is deriued oute of these wordes, <i>Apo tes chiros, cai tou ergou</i>, that is too bee vnderstanded, A hand working, and so it may be taken for al handy artes, But noble Ipocras sayth, that Surgerie is hande working in mans body, for the very ende and profite of Chirurgerie is hande working. Nowe the seconde manner of knowing what thing Chirurgerie is, it is the saying of Auicen to be knowen by his beeing, for it is verely a medecinal science: and as Galen sayth, he that wyl knowe the certentie of a thing, let him not busy him selfe to knowe only the name of that thing, but also the working and the effect of the same thing. Nowe the thirde way to knowe what thing Chirurgerie is, It is also to be knowen by his beeing or declaring of his owne properties, the which teacheth vs to worke in mannes body with handes: as thus, In cutting or opening those partes that be whole, and in healing those partes that be broke nor cut, and in taking away that that is superfluous, as warts, wennes, skurfulas, and other lyke. But further to declare what Galen sayth Surgery is, It is the laste instrument of medicine: That is to say, Dyet, Pocion, and Chirurgerie: of the whiche three, sayth he, Dyet is the noblest, and the most vertuous. And thus he sayth, whereas a man may be cured with Dyet onely, let there be geuen no maner of medicine. The seconde instrument is Pocion: for and if a man may be cured with Dyet and Pocion, let there not be ministred any Chirurgerie. The thirde and laste Instrument, is Chirurgerie, through whose vertue and goodnes is remoued and put away many greeuous infirmities and diseases, which might not haue bene remoued nor yet put away, neither with Diet, nor with Pocion. And by these three meanes it is knowen what thing Chirurgerie is.
