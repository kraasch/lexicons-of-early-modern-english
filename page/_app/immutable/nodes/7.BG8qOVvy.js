    (
    <em>LEME</em>
    ) was provided from 2006 to 2023 as a historical database of monolingual, bilingual, and polyglot dictionaries, lexical
    encyclopedias, hard-word glossaries, spelling lists, and lexically-valuable treatises surviving in print or manuscript
    from about 1475 to 1755. LEME is now available as a statice website.</p> <p>Texts of word-entries whose headword (source) or explanation (target) language is English tell us what speakers of
    English thought about their tongue in the period are served by the Short-title, Wing, and ESTC catalogues,. Their
    lexical insights, which may at times seem misguided to us, shaped the history of our living tongue. Any
    contemporary&#39;s testimony about the meaning of his own words has an undeniable authority. For this reason,
    <em>LEME</em>
    is not a period dictionary like
    <em>The Middle English Dictionary</em>
    or the yet unrealized Early Modern English period dictionary. The scholar who proposed the latter, Charles C. Fries,
    would have recognized
    <em>LEME</em>
    to be a source of &quot;contemporary comments&quot; that illustrate word usage. What Fries could not have imagined eighty years
    ago was a technology that would store all these quotations as distinct word-entries in searchable form.
    <em>LEME</em>
    incorporates some of what he hoped to create.</p> <p>Lexical information takes many forms in this period because the dictionary was an emerging genre. The notion of an
    English-only, monolingual lexicon was late in coming. Only in 1623, with Henry Cockeram&#39;s hard-word lexicon, did the
    term &quot;dictionary&quot; (first employed in English by Sir Thomas Elyot in 1538 for a bilingual lexicon) acquire a sense
    like that we take for granted today. Historical lexicons also take many different forms. Most <em>LEME</em>
    lexical texts have word-entries that open with a headword and close with an explanation of that headword, but explanations
    of words also appear inside informative treatises and literary editions with marginal glosses or notes that explain terminology.
    Encyclopedic or topical works, such as herbals and books of reference in medicine or law, sometimes offer logical definitions
    of things in subject-complement (&quot;is-a&quot;) form.</p> <p>Why compile a database of old dictionaries when English has the great <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>
    ? It gives an authoritative scientific account of the history and meaning of all English words, based on corpus-linguistic
    principles. That is, quotations support every definition. The  
    <em>OED</em>
    grows with the English language. Even a monumental work that covers 1500 years, however, necessarily selects lexical
    evidence. Jürgen Schäfer observed that Early Modern English quotations in the first edition of the OED predominantly
    come from major authors and overlook information in monolingual glossaries. Clarendon Press published Schäfer&#39;s
    <em>Early Modern English Lexicography</em>
    in 1989. It surveys 133 printed glossaries to 1640 and provides new evidence for 5,000
    <em>OED</em>
    entries. The OED has expanded its coverage of authors, thanks to Schäfer&#39;s achievement. Yet he does not provide the electronic
    data on which his extracts are based; and any English lexical expression in the explanations of huge bilingual dictionaries
    by the likes of Cotgrave, Florio, Minsheu, and Thomas Thomas, is hard to find and thus easily overlooked.</p>`,ie,C,Se=`<h2>Versions of <em>LEME</em></h2> <p>The <a href="/help">Introductory Help</a>
    section of the About menu describes the current version of LEME, provided as a set of static web files, which replaced
    the earlier dynamic LEME site on May 1, 2024.</p> <p>The information below describes this earlier dynamic version of LEME. A dockerized file set of the dynamic LEME site
    may be requested from Ian Lancashire to be run on local computers.</p> <h3>About the dynamic LEME site</h3> <p>The primary LEME database offers simple and advanced searches, including regular-expression and sub-string queries,
    and proximity and Boolean searches. The size of search contexts is adjustable. Queries on the lexical database may
    be restricted by date, author, title, type of lexical work, and subject. A complete word-list of the lexical
    database may be browsed. An index to over 1,400 known lexical works in the period may be searched by date, author,
    title, subject, and genre. </p> <p>There are two kinds of work in the <em>LEME</em>
    lexical database: analyzed and unanalyzed.</p> <p>Analyzed lexical works have been editorially segmented by headword, explanation, sub-headwords, sub-explanations,
    and cross-references. Their words are all encoded by language. Where possible, their English headwords have been
    lemmatized so that variant spellings of the headwords can be searched and retrieved together. Analyzed lexical works
    can also be displayed, page by page, entry by entry. The plain texts can be freely downloaded. Each analyzed
    word-entry has a permanent URL so that an online scholarly edition, dictionary, or critical work can cite a <em>LEME</em>
    word-entry in confidence that any online reader will be able to retrieve it.</p> <p>A few yet unanalyzed lexical works cannot be displayed, searches on them are global rather than restrictable, and
    their word-entries lack any permanent URL. <em>LEME</em>
    often includes a lexical work, in advance of its analysis, because more readers will want the opportunity to search a
    lexicon than to read one, entry by entry, given that EEBO/TCP and several well-known facsimile series make the texts
    of historical lexicons available as books or images of books.</p> <p>Knowing the position of a retrieved term in any word-entry is advantageous. For example, any term retrieved from a
    headword position in a monolingual English dictionary or glossary will usually be the direct subject of that entry.
    In this instance, a lexicographer explains an English word forthrightly, as Henry Cockeram (1623) does in the
    word-entry, &quot;Death. Mortality.&quot; Any English term retrieved from the explanation position in a bilingual or polyglot
    lexicon, on the other hand, generally translates a foreign-language word. Such English terms are not the <em>raison-d&#39;être</em>
    of the word-entry. That an English word corresponds to a foreign-language term helps us normally only if we understand
    that other language. The entry, &quot;Castillo a castell,&quot; in John Thorius&#39; rendering of a Spanish lexicon by Anthony de Corro,
    for instance, only helps us understand English &quot;castell&quot; if we know the meaning of the Spanish headword independently.
    Other corresponding English terms in the explanation segment of a bilingual lexicon, of course, are sometimes synonyms
    for the English word that is the subject of the query. However, the multiple senses of foreign-language words that are
    not semantically related in English itself may bring together English terms in an explanation. Consider John Florio&#39;s
    word-entry in 1598:</p> <p>Famigliare, <em>to set vp houshold, to become familiar, to tame. Also familiar, tame, gentle, acquainted, conuersant, a houshold
      guest.</em>
     </p> <p>When two people decided to live together in Elizabethan England, they did not necessarily intend to &quot;tame&quot; one
    another, Shakespeare&#39;s <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em>
    notwithstanding. Collocational proximity of English words in the explanation segment of a foreign-language lexicon does
    not guarantee their synonymity.</p> <p><em>LEME</em>
    enables readers to limit searches to different genres of lexical works, such as hard-word dictionaries on the one hand,
    and bilingual and polyglot dictionaries on the other. A word is marked differently by different lexical genres. If interested
    in new words introduced into English from other tongues, look at hard-word lexicons. To find the vocabulary of the mother
    tongue, consider the English words employed in bilingual and polyglot lexicons. Foreign-language dictionaries normally
    use common, well-accepted English words to explain foreign vocabulary.</p> <p>The <em>LEME</em>
    database includes a primary bibliography of 1400 early works known to have lexical information about English. The 250
    works in
    <em>LEME</em>
    thus are somewhat under eighteen percent of the lexical works of the Early Modern period. This total does not include
    the multiple versions or editions through which these texts went. The primary bibliography of all these lexical works
     are indexed by author, title, date, subject, and genre. The bibliographical entries served by these indexes give
    an example of the lexical content of the work and as full a coverage of secondary literature about it as possible.</p> <p>Simple search requests often give a reader hundreds of word-entries. The Modern Headwords word-index and search in <em>LEME</em>
    gives the reader only those word-entries that explicitly explain the search-term. Modern Headwords retrieves word-entries
    that have a headword in multiple alternate spellings, forms, and inflections. Headwords may be selected manually from
    a ready-made list. English ones can be retrieved both in alphabetical order and by part of speech. The analyzed part
    of the lexical database, in this way, gives readers a way of reducing the quantity of word-entries retrieved, and at
    the same time of increasing their relevance. The Modern Headwords word-list resembles the collected headwords in a regular
    dictionary. </p> <p><em>LEME</em>
    accepts the spelling of headwords in the Oxford English Dictionary as standard modern spellings because the Early Modern
    period lacks any accepted spelling system. This rule-of-thumb has some odd effects. It retains old spellings such as
    &quot;murther&quot; (which has a different OED headword from &quot;murder&quot;) and abandons ones like &quot;church-esset&quot; (which becomes &quot;church-scot&quot;).
    Lemmatization also reduces inflected forms to a standard inflection. For example, it converts all forms of a verb to
    the infinitive (except present participles that are used as nouns, and past particles that are used as adjectives), and
    the plural and genitive forms of a noun to the nominative case.</p> <p><br/></p>`,ne,x,De=`<h2>Editorial Procedures</h2> <p>The base text of any <em>LEME</em>
    lexical text is normally its earliest edition. A later edition may be substituted if it is more readily available.
    <em>LEME</em>
    bases its transcriptions on EEBO images of these texts, on published facsimiles, and on originals. Substantially different
    versions of the same work may be entered separately. </p> <p>Transcriptions retain original spelling, capitalization, and pointing or punctuation. For example, <em>u</em>
    and
    <em>v</em>
    , and
    <em>i</em>
    and
    <em>j</em>
    , are kept as they appear in the original. The following exceptions to this general practice hold: variant forms of
    <em>s</em>
    ,
    <em>r</em>
    ,
    <em>/</em>
    (virgule), end-of-line hyphen (
    <em>=</em>
    or
    <em>-</em>
    ), and
    <em>&amp;</em>
    (ampersand) are normalized to their modern forms; capital or long-
    <em>I</em>
    is represented as
    <em>I</em>
    , and capital
    <em>ff</em>
    as
    <em>F</em>
    ;
    <em>y</em>
    with a superior dot becomes
    <em>y</em>
    ; and all ligatures except
    <em>æ</em>
    and
    <em>œ</em>
    are separated. Capitalization varies widely from manuscript to manuscript. What, in general, may and may not be a capital
    (for example, the large form of
    <em>A</em>
    found in certain court hands) is determined by its presence or absence in medial position. Greek and Hebrew characters
    and ligatures are reproduced as faithfully as possible. Transcriptions record, in tags found in the underlying text,
    what forms of script (Anglicana or court hand, secretary, italic, round, etc.) and typeface (black letter, italic, roman,
    lapidary or monumental, etc.) are used at any point in a text but does not render the original script or typeface in
    the displayed text itself.</p> <p>Format is displayed only where it has functional significance. For example, paragraphing and lists are retained, but
    lineation is determined by the size of the display screen, and soft hyphens are not shown and do not cause a new
    line-break. Columns, hanging words, and the text of running titles, signatures, and catchwords are not retained,
    although folio and page numbers, and signatures appear in pagination tag. (We try to keep original lineation,
    however, in the underlying encoded text for ease of proofreading.) Tables present special problems: <em>LEME</em>
    reformats tabular word-entries so that they may be read.</p> <p>Some normalization occurs. Variation in the space separating two words is normalized to a single space. Sometimes
    faint printing has left certain pairs of characters confused (such as <em>f</em>
    and long-
    <em>s</em>
    ,
    <em>e</em>
    ,
    <em>c</em>
    , and
    <em>t</em>
    , and
    <em>u</em>
    and
    <em>n</em>
    ), although in context only one is possible. In these instances, which can be very numerous in some printed works, the
    correct letter is silently preferred rather than an incorrect letter that would require emendation.</p> <p>Abbreviations and contractions are expanded but are indicated in the text by coloured highlighting. A code for a
    brevigraph in the original appears in a tag surrounding the expansion in the underlying source text. The
    interpretation of a code for a brevigraph in the underlying encoded text may vary from one work to another because
    the practices of scribes and compositors vary. A few very common marks of abbreviation, particularly those still
    current now -- such as ampersand and types of money -- are unexpanded.</p> <p>Editorial emendations and letters supplied for damaged text are noted in the underlying source text and marked by a
    colour change in its text itself. Errata are treated as authorial emendations. A word incorrectly separated into two
    or more fragments, or two or more words incorrectly joined, are explicitly emended. The original reading and the
    source of the emendation, if any, appear in a tag surrounding the emendation. Original erroneous readings appear
    within a tag surrounding the correction in the underlying source text.</p> <p>Undated printed books are dated according to STC or Wing. Manuscript texts generally are dated by limits.</p> <p>Identification of sources for quotations or citations, and of proper and place names, is not yet attempted. A
    word-search will bring up all word-entries from preceding lexical works from which a word-entry may have been
    copied. <em>LEME</em>
    does not translate words or passages from non-English languages into English.</p> <p>The source text underlying a word-entry in the database shows the XML-like tagging by which segmentation and
    editorial functions are managed. The two formal XML schemas into which texts are converted for distribution and
    archiving are described elsewhere under the Help menu.</p> <p>The standard <em>LEME</em>
    model for word-entries imposes a minimalist structure: a form (with an editorially-encoded headword or lexeme), an explanation,
    and possibly a cross-reference, a sub-form and a sub-explanation, and a class type. Term tags identify language changes
    from one word to another. Word-entries are gathered within word-groups, and (where useful) word-groups into sections.
    This model does not imply much about a lexical theory held by any Early Modern English lexicographer. An &quot;explanation&quot;
    may includes translated equivalents, synonyms, logical definitions (of things), conceptualizations, etymologies, and
    even anecdotal digressions. LEME does not usually assign different senses to the post-lemmatic words and phrases in the
    explanation.
    <em>LEME</em>
    makes as few modern assumptions about lexical meaning as possible.</p> <p>Anyone quoting passages from LEME is encouraged to check them against an EEBO facsimile. We do our best but cannot
    guarantee accuracy. If we are informed of a mistake, we will correct it.</p> <p>The full LEME Editor&#39;s Manual is available on the Editor&#39;s <a href="https://leme.utoronto.ca">LEME Corpus</a>
    site.</p>`,ae,T,Ae=`<h2>History of LEME</h2> <p>Twenty-nine years ago, Gail Richardson and I began work on what is now <em>LEME</em>
    with John Palsgrave&#39;s
    <em>Lesclarcissement</em>
    (1530), a large English-French dictionary dedicated to Henry VIII. Randle Cotgrave&#39;s French-English dictionary (1611)
    joined the Palsgrave in time for the 1992 ICAME conference at Nijmegen. Four more works were in place by the following
    year: Latin-English dictionaries by Sir Thomas Elyot (1538) and Thomas Thomas (1587), an Italian-English dictionary by
    William Thomas (1550), and an English hard-word lexicon by Robert Cawdrey (1604). John Florio&#39;s first Italian-English
    lexicon (1598) and Henry Cockeram&#39;s English dictionary (1623) were added by 1994. Two years later, the
    <em>Early Modern English Dictionaries Database</em>
    (
    <em>EMEDD</em>
    ) went online at the Centre for Computing in the Humanities in Toronto with Palsgrave, the two Thomases, John Minsheu&#39;s
    Spanish-English lexicon (1599), John Bullokar&#39;s hard-word English dictionary (1616), and Thomas Blount&#39;s
    <em>Glossographia</em>
    (1656). By 1999, in its final form,
    <em>EMEDD</em>
    was supplemented with scientific glossaries by Bartholomew Traheron (1543) and John Garfield (1657), William Turner&#39;s
    herbal of 1548, Richard Mulcaster&#39;s word-list (1582), and Edmund Coote&#39;s hard-word glossary (1596).</p> <p><em>EMEDD</em>
    was free. It enabled registered researchers to do single-word and proximity searches on one or all of these lexicons.
    Word-entries were retrieved from an Open Text Corporation
    <em>Pat</em>
    textbase of about 200,000 word-entries in all. Small to very large contexts were allowed, and a total of 100 hits was
    permitted for each search. Texts were segmented by word-entry in order to be processed by
    <em>Pat</em>
    and output with
    <em>Patterweb</em>
    , an interface developed by my former student Mark Catt.</p> <p>The design of <em>LEME</em>
    texts has changed over time. Influenced by the Text-Encoding Initiative, they were at first intended to be SGML-encoded
    diplomatic transcriptions of single copies of original editions. Especially with online access to facsimile images of
    texts in EEBO, as well as the influence of the Text Encoding Initiative (which did not recommend capturing display features),
    I adjusted both text-entry and encoding to the needs of a database. The more lexical works in the database, the less
    prescriptive
    <em>LEME</em>
    &#39;s model had to become.</p> <p>A four-year grant by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada enabled me to begin <em>LEME</em>
    in 2000. In the next few years, the University of Toronto Library and I started building the
    <em>LEME</em>
    database. For eight years Dr. Marc Plamondon was our programmer, supervised by Sian Meikle and myself. By mid-2004, a
    very generous sub-grant from the Geoffrey Rockwell&#39;s TAPoR project at McMaster University, part of a six-institution
    Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) grant, enabled us to produce the alpha version of
    <em>LEME</em>
    for release to that network of partners in November 2004. This became a beta-version in mid-2005. Another grant from
    SSHRC in early 2005 further increased the pace of
    <em>LEME</em>
    data-entry and programming. The University of Toronto Press and Library formally launched
    <em>LEME</em>
    on April 12, 2006.</p> <p>Public funding, the strong support of colleagues in peer review, and partnership with the University of Toronto
    Library and Press (thanks to the unflagging support of Carole Moore, the Chief Librarian) made <em>LEME</em>
    possible. Its public accessibility arises from the process of its making. Its initial licensing arose from the requirements
    of the granting agency. We owe the second version of
    <em>LEME</em>
    (2018) again to the University of Toronto Library (especially Sian Meikle, Director of ITS, and the Chief Librarian,
    Larry Alford), the University of Toronto Press, and SSHRC. </p> <p>LEME is far from the work of one person. It is built on the hard work of over 90 people, including programmers,
    donars, colleagues, graduate students, and a wonderful host of  undergraduate research assistants. Their
    enthusiasm buoyed me for over thirty years. Their expertise, their collegiality and faith in this project, the
    unflagging professional diligence with which they marshalled these lexical texts, and the heart-warming personal
    encouragement they gave me over some lean years have made me possibly the most fortunate computing humanist of my
    generation. </p> <p>My own personal efforts in all this, I dedicate to Anne Begor Lancashire.</p> <p>For more details about LEME&#39;s history, please refer to the Editor&#39;s <a href="https://leme.utoronto.ca">LEME Corpus</a>
