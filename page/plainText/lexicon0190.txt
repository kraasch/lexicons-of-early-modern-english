Spanish and French tongues.

ted with neither of them, learne either or
both. Made in Spanish, by M. An­
thonie de Corro.

The Epistle to the Reader.


GEntle Reader, many suppo­
sing their Bookes to bee no 
bookes, vnlesse they bee en­
larged with tedious prefa­
ces; they abuse the Readers
curtesie with superfluous relations: filling
the first sheete with vaine prayses of the
matter and subiect of their Pamphlets. I 
therfore vnwilling to staie you with need­
lesse prayses; meane not heare to write an
 in commendation of the Spanish or
French tongue: leauing the consideration
therof vnto euery one his liking, to thinke
of these tongues according to their owne
opinion or pleasure.  But thus muche I
thought necessary to aduertise the Reader
of; that this Grammar was first written
the greater part of it in Spanish, and a litle
of the ende in French; in such manner that
none could reape any benefit by reading of
it, but such as were acquainted with both
the foresayd languages. In so much that I
beeing requested by diuers, but especially





mooued with loue and affection toward
my country men (beeing most ready at all
time to vndertake any labour to procure
their ease, and imploy my dearest time to 
do them pleasure) haue in such sort trans­
lated & altered this booke, that any Eng­
lish man may vse it to his profite. And to
the ende that the one language may easily
be knowne from the other, I haue caused it
to be printed in three sundry kindes of let­
ters. Besides this, for better order and to a­
uoyde all confusion, I haue deuided it into 
sundry parts and sexions: and at the ende
added a Dictionarie of all the Spanish
words set down for example in this Gram­
mar, and also many other wordes most v­
sed. Which paynes (gentle Reader) I shall
thinke well imployde if it may doo you
good and redowne to your profit: reque­
sting no other meede for my labour, then 
to haue it accepted as a token of my good
will and meaning.  And thus I commit
you to your accustomed exercises, and the 
further reading of our Grammar.
