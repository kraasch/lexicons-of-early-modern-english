To the Reader.


SVch as by their place and cal|
ling (but especially Preachers).
as haue occasion to speake pub|
liquely before the ignorant peo|
ple, are to be admonished, that they neuer
affect any strange inkhorn tearmes, but la|
bour to speke so as is commonly receiued,
and so as the most ignorant may well vnder|
stand them neyther seeking to be ouer fine
or curious, nor yet liuing ouer carelesse, vsing
their speech as most men doe, and ordering
their wits as the fewest haue done. Some men
seeke so far for outlandish English, that they
forget altogether their mothers language, so
that if some of their mothers were aliue, they
were not able to tell or vnderstand what they
say; and yet these fine English Clearkes will
say they speake in their mother tongue; but
one might well charge them for counterfay|
ting the Kings English. Also, some far iour|
aied gentlemen, at their returne home, like



as they loue to goe in forraine apparrell, so
they will pouder their talke with ouer-sea 
language. He that commeth lately out of 
France, will talke French English, and neuer
blush at the matter. Another chops in with
English Italianated, and applyeth the Italian
phrase to our English speaking, the which is
as if an Orator, that professeth to vtter his
minde in plaine Latine, would needs speake
Poetrie, & far fetched colours of strange an|
tiquitie. Doth any wise man thinke, that wit
resteth in strange words, or else standeth it
not in wholsome matter, and apt declaring of
a mans minde? Doe we not speake, because
we would haue others to vnderstand vs? or is
not the tongue giuen for this end, that one
might know what another meaneth? There|
fore, either wee must make a difference of
English, and say, some is learned English, and
othersome is rude English, or the one is
Court talke, the other is Country-speech, or
else wee must of necessitie banish all affected
Rhetorique, and vse altogether one manner
of language. Those therefore that will auoid
this follie, and acquaint themselues with the
plainest and best kinde of speach, must seeke
from time to time such wordes as are com|



monly receiued, & such as properly may ex|
presse in plaine manner, the whole conceit of
their minde. And looke what words we best
vnderstand, and know what they meane, the
same should soonest be spoken, and first ap|
plyed, to the vtterance of our purpose. Ther|
fore for this end, foure things would chiefly
be obserued in the choyse of words. First,
that such words as wee vse, should be pro|
per vnto the tongue wherein we speake. A|
gaine, that they be plaine for all men to per|
ceiue. Thirdly, that they be apt and meete,
most properly to set out the matter. Fourth|
lie, that words translated, from one signi|
fication to another, (called of the Grecians
Tropes,) be vsed to beautifie the sentence, as
precious stones are set in a ring, to commend
the gold. Now such are thought apt words,
that properly agree vnto that thing, which
they signifie, and plainly expresse the nature
of the same. Therefore, they that haue re|
gard of their estimation and credite, doe wa|
rily speake, & with choise, vtter words most
apt for their purpose. in waightie causes,
graue wordes are thought most needfull
that the greatnesse of the matter, may the ra|
ther appeare, in the vehemencie of their




talke. So likewise of other, like order must
be taken. Albeit some, not onely doe not
obserue this kinde of aptnesse, but also they
fall into much fondnes, by vsing words out
of place and applying them to diuers mat|
ters, without all discretion.

If thou be desirous (gentle Reader) right|
ly and readily to vnderstand, and to profit
by this Table, and such like, then thou must
learne the Alphabet, to wit, the order of the
Letters as they stand, perfectly without
booke, and where euery Letter standeth: as
(b) neere the beginning, (n) about the mid|
dest, and (t) toward the end. Now if the
word, which thou are desirous to finde, be|
gin with (a) then looke in the beginning of
this Table, but if with (v) looke towards the
end. Again, if thy word begin with (ca) looke
in the beginning of the Letter (c) but if with
(cu) then looke toward the end of that Let|
ter. And so of all the rest, &c.

And further vnderstand, that all such words
as are deriued and drawne from the Greeke,
are noted with this letter (g.) And the French
are marked thus (&#x27;) but such words as are de|
riued from the Latine and others, haue no
marke at all.
