Our Canting Alphabet will not extend a Letter
farther then T, as far as I can find out; not know­
ing any Canting word beginning with V, X, Y, Z,
although I have made a strict inquiry from some of
the most notorious Professors hereof: I have con­
sulted likewise what is printed on this subject, and
have slighted no help I could gather from thence,
which indeed is very little; the greatest assistance
I had in this discovery, was from Newgate; which
with much difficulty I screw'd out of the sullen
Rogues, who would not speak a word till I had
suppled their tongues with the oil of Barley, or ra­
ther thaw'd their obstinate silence with the heat
of strong Liquors.

From these I understood, that the Mode of 
Canting alter'd very often, and that they were for­
ced to change frequently those material words which
chiefly discovered their mysterious practices and



Villanies, least growing too common their own
words should betray them.

Here in this Vocabulary or little Canting Dicti­
onary, You have all or most of the old words
which are still in use, and a many new never pub­
blished in print, and but very lately minted, such
too which have passed the approbation of the Criti­
cal Canter. If I seem deficient in the quantity of
words, let some else supply my defects, having
collected words sufficiently enough for one, if you
will have more, take the pains which I have done
to be supplyed, and in the mean time be content
with what is gathered to your hands.
