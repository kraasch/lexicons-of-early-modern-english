dyous treatyse of sclaun­
dre / declarynge what 
sclaundre is / and what 
it sygnifyeth / and how 
many kyndes of 
sclaundre 
there 
be.


¶Wo be vnto him by
whom sclaundre com­
meth. Mathew. xviii.
Beware therfore what
thou spekest / of whom 
and by whom / that it be
not for euyll wyl or ma­
lyce/ lest thou be in daun­
gre of iudgement.






SClaundre is or 
sygnifieth an of­
fence / whereby 
mans mynd is 
sore disquietid 
or trobled: that 
is to say / it is other discoura­
ged or couraged to or from the 
imitacyon or folowynge of a 
thing.

❧ There is a double 
kynde of sclaundre / one is pha­
risaycall / which comenly they 

ii. maner
of sclaun­
dres. one
pharisey­
call/ ano­
ther cal­
led sclun­
dre taken.

call sclaundre taken: and that 
is whan that ypocrytes be of­
fended other with right doctry­
ne / or with necessary doyng / & 
therupon cometh hatred of the 
gospell and of godly men: as 
the pharisyes hated the gospel 

Mat.xv

and the teachers of the same / & 
pretended gret causes of their 
grefe & hatered taken of mans 



wytte & reason: for what man 
endued but with a meane wyt 
wolde not be greued / that the 
facyon of relygion shulde any 
thing decay / that comen peace 
shuld be disquyeted / that sys­
mes shulde ryse in the church / 
that hye powers and commen 
welthes shulde be brought to 
nought. They sawe that their 
relygion & maner of worship­
ping of god was lytle estemed 
and that the comen welth was 
hyndred / and the auctoritye 
of superyoures contempned: 
But although these be great 
causes / which worthely doth 
moue men / yet it is mete to 
know / that before these causes 
yea / before all thynges / that 
the commaundement of god be 
prefarred after this rule: It is 



necessary rather to obeye God 

Actu. v.

than men. Therfore this pha­
risaycall sclaunder or offence 
is not to be eschewed / for the 
commaundement of god excuseth 
vs. But it is necessary the doc­
tryne be true certayne & profy­
table to the church. For it is a 
very greuous syn to troble the 
church with euyll / vncertayne 
or vnprofytable disputacions.

❧ There is another kynde of 

Sclaun­
dre gyuen

sclaundre / which they call sclaun­
dre gyuen. And it is vngodly 
doctryne or euyl example which 
hurteth / other bycause they fo­
lowe it / or bycause it scarreth 
men from the gospell. All wyc­
ked doctrynes ar sclaundres & 
offences of this kynde. Also i­
dolatrers worshippynge and 
mens inuencyons / which can 



not be obserued & kept without 
synne: as worshippyng of y­
mages / goyng on pylgryma­
ges / purchasyng of popysshe 
pardons for remissyon of syn­
nes. Christ threat the auctors 
of these sclaunders chefely. 

❧ Wo be to the men by whom

Mathei
xviii.

sclaundre cometh. &ce. Than
these sclaundres and offences
with great dilygence must be
eschewed / lest we be other auc­
tours or alowers of vngodly
doctryne & folowers of suche
wycked worshippyng. &c.


"sclaundre gyuen" not found in OED.



There is also a nother kynd 

A title of
the vse
of lyber­
tye.

of sclaundre to be eschewed / 
that is / whan that a work which 
is indyfferent / is done out of 
tyme: as the vntymely vse of 
christyan lyberte. Of this ly­
berte / there is often dysputa­



cyon and reasonyng / whan it 
is lawfull / and whan it is not 
lawfull. It is synne to breake 
mens tradicyons / in case that 
the brekyng of them shulde be 
occasyon of sclaundre or offence 
to any man. Therfore the rule 
of Poule is to be hold as tou­
chyng the vse of lyberte. Poul 

Rom. xi.

commaundeth the lerned men to 
bere thinfyrmyte of the vnler­
ned and weke / & folowe their 
myndes / and certify them for 
their good & for their edifyeng 
that is / that through their gen­
tylnes they may courage them 
to the Gospell and not skarre 
them: For not alonly ipocryts 
and the vngodly sorte / but al­
so godly men / & men of sobre 
lyuyng / specyally they that be 
not taught nor suffyciently in­



structe whan they se auncyent 
customes broken / they iudge 
by that maner of doctryne / 
men to be gyuen to a wylde ly­
berte / and become all vngodly 
and so be skarred from the know­
ledge of the gospell. Therfore 
lybertye is not to be vsed afore 
them which haue not yet herd 
this maner of doctryne / as a 
fore / men not yet suffycyently 
confyrmed / but thexample of 
saynt Poule is to be folowed: 
I haue ben weke to them that 

i. Corin.
viii.

are weke: If my meate doth 
offende my brother / I wyl ne­
uer eate flesshe / lest I offende 
my brother. But now where 
as the gospell is clerely prea­
ched / and the church meanely 
confirmed in the same / the gre­
uous obseruacyon of vnprofy­



table tradicyons is not gretly 
to be requyred. yea / Poul for 
to shew example of lyberte / he 
wolde not syrcumcyse Tyte. 

Gala. ii.

And Christ excused his Apo­
stles / brekyng the tradicyons 

Mathei.
xxv.

of the fathers / and sayth: Let 
them alone / they be blynd / and 

Mat. xv
xx.iii.

gydes of the blynde. &ce. But 
yet in this thyng it is good to 
vse sobrenesse and dyscrecyon / 
for euen amonge enemyes ther 
be some that rather shulde be 
reconsyled than styred & prouo­
ked / and it becommeth christen 
men to refarre all their doinges
not to their owne affectyons & 
lustes / but vnto the profyte of 
other / & to the glory of Christ. 

Apoc. v.

But many there be that breke 
auncyent customes / not to pro­
fyte or do seruyce to other / or 



to do better thynges / but by­
cause this lyberte delyteth them. 
This is a wycked thynge to 
dyspyce auncyent customes & 
lawes / it is no christyan thinge 
Furthermore / the brekynge of 
comen customes / redily stores 
vp gret vprore / and commocions 
ought not rasshely to be excy­
ted: for it is an harde thynge 
afterward to haue conscyence 
that thou hast gyuen occasyon 
of comen calamytes & myseres
