A treatise 
of Schemes & Tropes
very profytable 
for the better vnderstanding of good 
authors, gathered out of the best 
Grammarians & Oratours
by Rychard Sherry Lon­
doner.

¶ Whervnto is added a declamation,
That chyldren euen strayt from their
infancie should be well and gent­
ly broughte vp in learnynge.
Written fyrst in Latin
by the most excel­
lent and
famous Clearke, Erasmus
of Rotero­
dame.







To the ryght worshyp­
ful Master Thomas Brooke 
Esquire, Rychard Shyrrey 
wysheth health euer­
lastynge. 




The tytle of
thys worche
straunge.


I Doubt not but 
that the title of 
this treatise all 
straunge vnto 
our Englyshe 
eares, wil cause 
some men at the fyrst syghte to 
maruayle what the matter of 
it should meane: yea, and per­
aduenture if they be rashe of 
iudgement, to cal it some newe 
fangle, and so casting it hasti­
ly from theem, wil not once vouch 
safe to reade it: and if they do, 
yet perceiuynge nothing to be 
therin that pleaseth their phan­
sy, wyl count it but a tryfle, & a




tale of Robynhoode. But of 
thys sorte as I doubte not to 
fynde manye, so perhaps there 
wyll be other, whiche moued 
with the noueltye thereof, wyll 
thynke it worthye to be looked 
vpon, and se what is contained 
therin. These words, Scheme and 

Sheme and
Trope.

Trope, are 
not vsed in our Eng­
lishe tongue, neither bene they 
Englyshe wordes. No more 

Vse maketh
straunge thin­
ges familier.

be manye whiche nowe in oure 
tyme be made by continual vse, 
very familier to most men, and 
come so often in speakyng, that 
aswel is knowen amongest vs 
the meanyng of them, as if they 
had bene of oure owne natiue 
broode. Who hath not in hys 
mouthe nowe thys worde Pa­
raphrasis, homelies, vsurped, 
abolyshed, wyth manye other 




lyke? And what maruail is it if 
these words haue not bene vsed 
here tofore, seynge there was no 
suche thynge in oure Englishe 
tongue where vnto they shuld be 
applyed? Good cause haue we 
therefore to gyue thankes vnto 
certayne godlye and well lear­
ned men, whych by their greate 
studye enrychynge our tongue 
both wyth matter and wordes, 
haue endeuoured to make it so 
copyous and plentyfull that 
therein it maye compare wyth 
anye other whiche so euer is the 
best. It is not vnknowen that 
oure language for the barba­
rousnes and lacke of eloquence 

Oure lan­
guage falsely
accused of
barbarous­
nes.

hathe bene complayned of, and 
yet not trewely, for anye defaut 
in the toungue it selfe, but 




rather for slackenes of our coun­
trimen, whiche haue alwayes
set lyght by searchyng out the 
elegance and proper speaches 
that be ful many in it: as plain­
ly doth appere not only by the 
most excellent monumentes of 
our auncient forewriters, 

Gower.
Chawcer.
Lidgate.

Gow­
er, Chawcer and Lydgate, but 
also by the famous workes of 
many other later: inespeciall 
of the ryght worshipful knyght 

Syr Thomas
Elyot.

syr Thomas Eliot, which first 
in hys dictionarye as it were 
generallye searchinge oute the 
copye of oure language in all 
kynde of wordes and phrases, 
after that setting abrode good­
lye monumentes of hys wytte, 
lernynge and industrye, aswell 
in historycall knowledge, as 
of eyther the Philosophies, 




hathe herebi declared the plen­
tyfulnes of our mother tounge, 
loue toward hys country, hys 
tyme not spent in vanitye and 
tryfles. What shuld I speake 
of that ornamente Syr Tho­
mas Wyat? which beside most 
excellente gyftes bothe of for­
tune and bodye, so flouryshed 
in the eloquence of hys natiue 
tongue, that as he passed ther­
in those wyth whome he lyued, 
so was he lykelye to haue bene 
equal wyth anye other before 
hym, had not enuious death to 
hastely beriued vs of thys iew­
el: teachyng al men verely, no 
filicitie in thys worlde to be so 
suer and stable, but that quick­
lye it may be ouerthrowen and 
broughte to the grounde. Ma­
nye other there be yet lyuynge 




whose excellente wrytynges do 
testifye wyth vs to be wordes 
apte and mete elogantly to de­
clare oure myndes in al kindes 
of Sciences; and that, what 
sentence soeuer we conceiue, the 
same to haue Englyshe oracion 
natural, and, holpen by art, wher­
by it may most eloquently be vt­
tered. Of the whych thynge as 
I fortuned to talke wyth you, 
Master Brooke, among other 
matters this present argument 
of Schemes and Tropes came 
in place, and offered it selfe, de­
med to be bothe profitable and 
pleasaunte if they were gathe­
red together, and handsomelye 
set in a playne ordre, and wyth 
theire descriptions hansomely 
put into our Englishe tongue. 




And bicause longe ago, I was 
well acquaynted wyth them, 
when I red them to other in the 
Latin, and that they holpe me 
verye muche in the exposicion 
of good authoures, I was so 
muche the more ready to make 
them speak English: partli, to 
renew the pleasure of mine old 
studies, and partelye to satys­
fy your request. 

Beside this, I was moued al­
so wyth the authorytye of 

Rodulphus
Agricola.

that famous clarke Rodul­
phus Agricola, whyche in a 
certeine Epistle wrytten vnto 
a frynde of hys, exhorteth men 
what soeuer they reade in 
straunge tongues, diligently 
to translate the same into their 
owne language: because that 
in it we sonar perceiue if there 




be any faute in our speaking, 
and howe euerye thynge ey­
ther rightly hangeth together 
or is darkelye, ruggishly, and 
superfluously wrytten. No ler­
ned nacion hath there bene but 
the learned in it haue written of 
schemes & fygures, which thei 
wold not haue don, except thei 
had perceyued the valewe. 

Wherfore after theyr example 
obtaynyng a lytle lesure, I red 
ouer sundrye treatises, as wel 
of those which wrot long ago, 
as of others now in our daies: 
fyndynge amonge them some 
to haue wrytten ouer brieflye, 
some confuselye, and falselye 

Mosellane

some. Mosellane hathe in hys 
tables shewed a fewe fygures 
of grammer, and so hathe con­
founded them together, that his 




second order called of Loquu­
cion pertayneth rather to the 
rhetoricians then to hys pur­

Quintilian.

pose. Quintilian briefly hathe 
wrytten bothe of the Grama­
tical and rhetorical Shemes, 
but so that you may soone per­
ceyue he did it by the waye, as 
muche as serued hys purpose. 

Cicero.
 
Cicero in hys boke of an ora­
tour wyth hys incomperable 
eloquence hathe so hid the pre­
ceptes, that scarselye they may 
be tryed oute by theyr names, 

Erasmus.

or by theyr examples. Erasmus 
in hys double copye of words 
and thynges, hath made as the 
tytle declareth but a comenta­
rye of them bothe, and as it 
wer a litle bil of remembraunce. 
Wherfore to make these thin­
ges more playne to the students 




that lyst to reade them in oure 
tongue, I haue taken a lytle 
payne, more thorowelye to try 
the definicions, to apply the ex­
amples more aptly, & to make 
things defused more plaine, as 
in dede it shal ryght wel apere 
to the dylygente. I haue not 
translated them orderly out of 
anye one author, but runninge 
as I sayde thorowe many, and 
vsyng myne owne iudgement, 
haue broughte them into this 
body as you se, and set them in 
so playne an order, that redelye 
maye be founde the figure, and 
the vse wherevnto it serueth. 
Thoughe vnto greate wittes 
occupyed wyth weightye mat­
ters, they do not greatelye per­
tayne, yet to such as perchaunce 
shal not haue perfecte instruc­
 




toures, they may be commodi­
ous to helpe them selues for the 
better vnderstandynge of such 
good authors as they reade. 

For thys darre I saye, no elo­
quente wryter maye be percei­
ued as he shulde be wythoute 
the knowledge of them: for as­
muche as al togethers they be­
longe to Eloquucion, whyche 
is the thyrde and pryncipall 
parte of rhetorique. The com­
mon scholemasters be wont in 
readynge, to saye vnto their 
scholers: Hic est figura: and some­
tyme to axe them, Per quam figu­
ram? But what profit is herein 
if they go no further? In spea­
kynge and wrytynge nothyng 
is more folyshe than to affecte 
or fondly to laboure to speake 
darkelye for the nonce, sithe the 




proper vse of speach is to vtter 
the meaning of our mynd with 
as playne wordes as maye be. 
But syth it so chaunseth that som
tyme ether of necessitie, or to set 
out the matter more plainly we 
be compelled to speake other­
wyse then after common faci­
on, onles we wil be ignorante 
in the sence or meaninge of the 
mater that excellente authors 
do wryghte of, we muste nedes 
runne to the helpe of schemes 
& fygures: which verely come 
no sildomer in the writing and 
speaking of eloquente english 
men, then either of Grecians or 
Latins. Many thinges might 
I brynge in to proue not one­
ly a great profyt to be in them 
but that they are to be learned 
euen of necessitie, for as muche 




as not only prophane authors 
wythout them may not be wel 
vnderstand, but that also they 
greatelye profit vs in the rea­
dinge of holye scripture, where 
if you be ignoraunte in the fy­
guratiue speches and Tropes, 
you are lyke in manye greate 
doubtes to make to make but a slender 
solucion: as ryght wyll do te­

Vestimerus

stefy Castelio Vestimerus and that no­

Augustinus

ble doctor saint Augustine. I 
confesse I haue not made the 
matter here so perfecte as my 
wyll and desyer is it shoulde 
haue ben, and that I haue but 
brieflye touched, and as it were 
with my litle fynger poynted 
to these thinges, which require 
a lenger declaracion. For what 
can be hasted, and absolute to? 
But if God spare me lyfe, I 




truste hereafter to make it an 
introduccion, wherbi our youth 
not onlye shall saue that moste 
precious Iewell, Time, whyle 
they wander by them selues, re­
adynge at all aduentures sun­
dry and varyous authors: but 
that also thei shalbe able better 
to vnderstande and iudge of 
the goodlye gyftes and orna­
mentes in mooste famous and 
eloquente oratoures. For as 

And apte si­
militude.

lyke plesure is not to him whi­
che gooeth into a goodlye gar­
den garnyshed wyth dyuers 
kindes of herbes and flowers, 
and that there doeth no more 
but beholde them, of whome it 
maye be sayde that he wente in 
for nothynge but that he wold 
come out, and to hym which be­
syde the corporall eie pleasure, 




knoeth of eueri one the name & 
propertye: so verelye much dif­
ference is there in readynge 
good authors, and in sundrye 
sortes of menne that do it: and 
muche more pleasure, and pro­
fit hathe he whiche vseth arte 
and iudgement, then the other, 
whiche wyth greate studye in 
dede turneth them ouer but for 
lacke of the knowledge of pre­
ceptes wanteth also the fruite 
and delectacyon that he more 
amplye myghte obtayne. The 
lyuynge God from whome all 
good giftes do procede, gyue 
vs grace so to order all oure 
words and speache, that it may 
be to his honour and glory for 
euer and euer. Amen.

¶ A briefe note of eloqucion, the third 
parte of Rhetoricke, wherunto 
all Figures and Tropes be 
referred.


Eloquucion

ELoquucion , which 
the Greekes call 
Phrase, whereof 
also the name of 
eloquence dothe 
ryse, as of al par­
tes it is the good­
lyest, so also is it the most profita­
ble and hardeste: in the whyche is 
seene that diuine myghte and ver­
tue of an oratoure, whych as Cice­
ro in hys oratorie particions defi­
neth, is nothyng else but wisedom 
speakyng eloquently. For vnto the 
maruelous greate inuencion of all 
thynges, bothe it addeth a fulnes, 
and varietie: it setteth oute & gar­
nysheth wyth lyghtes of eloquent 
speche, the thinges that be spoken 
of, and also wyth very graue sen­
tences, choyse wordes, proper, apt­
ly translated, and wel soundyng, it 
bryngeth that greate fludde of elo­
quence, vnto a certein kynd of stile 




and indyghtyng. And oute of thys 
greate streame of eloquucion, not 
only must we chose apte, and mete 
wordes, but also take hede of pla­
cinge, and settinge them in order. 
For the myghte and power of elo­
quucion consisteth in wordes con­
sidered by them selues, and when 
they be ioyned together. Apt wor­
des by searchyng muste be founde 
oute, and after by diligence conue­
niently coupled. For there is a gar­
nyshynge, euen when they be pure 
and fyne by them selues, and an o­
ther, when they be ioyned together. 
To chose them oute finely, and hand­
somlye to bestow them in their pla­
ces, after the mynde of Cicero and 
Quintilian, is no easy thynge. So 
Marcus Antonius was wonte to 
say, that he had knowen many wel 
spoken men, but none eloquente. 

Tullye and Quintilian thoughte 
that inuencion and disposicion were 
the partes of a wytty and prudent 
man, but eloquence of an oratour. 
For howe to finde out matter, and 
set it in order, may be comen to all 
men, whyche eyther make abridge­ 




mentes of the excellent workes of 
aunciente wryters, and put histo­
ries in remembraunce, or that speake 
of anye matter themselues: but to 
vtter the mynde aptely, distinctly, 
and ornately, is a gyft geuen to ve­
ry fewe. And because we haue deui­
ded eloquucion into two partes, 
that is, wordes symple, or conside­
red by them selues, and compound 
or ioyned together in speache, ac­
cordyng to thys we saye, that eue­
rye eloquente oracion must haue in 
it thre poyntes: euidence, which be­
longeth to the fyrst parte of eloquu­
cion, composicion & dignitie, which 
belongeth to the order.



Of Euidence and plainenes. 

Of these thynges that we put in 
eloquucion, lette thys be the fyrste 
care, to speake euidentlye after the 
dignitye and nature of thynges, 
and to vtter suche wordes, whych 
as Cicero sayth in hys oratour, no 
man may iustely reprehende. The 
playne and euident speche is lear­
ned of Gramarians, and it kee­
peth the oracion pure, and without 
all faute, and maketh that euerye 




thyng may seme to be spoken pure­
lye apertlye, and clerelye. Euerye 
speche standeth by vsuall wordes 
that be in vse of daylye talke, and 
proper wordes that belonge to the 
thinge, of the which we shal speke. 
Neyther be properties to be refer­
red onely to the name of the thing, 
but much more to the strength and 
power of the significacion: & must 
be considered not by hearyng, but 
by vnderstandyng. So translacion 
in the whych comonly is the grea­
test vse of eloquucion, applieth wor­
des not the selfe proper thinges. 
But yet an vnvsed worde or po­
etical, hath also somtyme in the o­
racion hys dignitie, and beyng put 
in place (as Cicero sayeth) often­
tymes the oracion may seme grea­
ter, and of more antiquitie, for that 
Poetes do speake in a maner as it 
were in a nother tonge, it is righte 
sone perceiued. Finally two fautes 
are committed in euerye language, 
whereby it is not pure: Barbaris­
me, and Solecisme. Of the whych, 
that on is committed, when anye 
worde is fautely spoken or writen: 




that other, when in many wordes 
ioyned together, the worde that fo­
loweth is not wel applyed to that 
that goeth before.
"Barbarism" antedates the earliest OED citation (1578), and "Solecism" antedates the earliest OED citation (1577).
 Of composicion 
and dygnitye, we wyll speake here 
after, when we come to the figures 
of rethoryque. 



Of the three kyndes of style 
or endyghtynge. 

Before we come to the precepts 
of garnishing an oracion, we thinke 
good, bryeffye to shewe you of the 
thre kyndes of stile or endyghting, 
in the whych all the eloquucion of 
an oratoure is occupied. For that 
there be thre sundry kyndes, called 
of the Grekes characters, of vs fi­
gures, I trowe there is no man, 
though he be meanlye learned, but 
he knoweth, namely when we se so 
manye wryters of sciences, bothe 
Greke and latine, whych haue ben 
before tyme, to haue folowed for 
the mooste parte sundrye sortes of 
wrytyng, the one vnlyke to the o­
ther. And there hath bene marked 
inespecially thre kyndes of endigh­
tynge: The greate, the small, the 
meane.





The greate kynde. 

The greate, the noble, the migh­
tye, and the full kynde of endygh­
tynge, wyth an incredible, & a cer­
ten diuine power of oracion, is v­
sed in wayghty causes: for it hathe 
wyth an ample maiestye verye gar­
nyshed wordes, proper, translated, 
& graue sentences, whych ar hand­
led in amplificacion, and commise­
racion, and it hathe exornacions 
bothe of woordes and sentences, 
wherunto in oracions they ascribe 
verye great strength and grauitie. 
And they that vse thys kynde, bee 
vehement, various, copious, graue, 
appoynted and readye thorowlye 
to moue and turne mens myndes. 
Thys kynd dyd Cicero vse in the o­
racion for Aulus Cluencius, for 
Sylla, for Titus Annius Milo, 
for Caius Rabirius: agaynste Ca­
tiline, agaynste Verres, agaynste 
Piso. But they that can not skyll 
of it oftentimes fall into fautes, 
when vnto them that seemeth a 
graue oracion, whych swelleth, and 
is puffed vp, whych vseth straunge 
wordes hardelye translated, or to 




olde, and that be nowe longe sy­
thens lefte of from vse of daylye 
talke, or more graue then the thing 
requyreth.



The small kynde. 

The small kynde of indighting, 
is in a subtile, pressed, and fyled ora­
cion, meete for causes that be a ly­
tel sharper then are in the comon 
vse of speakynge. For it is a kynde 
of oracion that is lette downe euen 
to the mooste vsed custume of pure 
and clere speakyng. It hathe fyne 
sentences, subtile, sharpe, teachyng 
all thynges, and makynge them 
more playne, not more ample. 

And in the same kynde (as Cicero 
sayeth in hys oratoure) some bee 
craftye, but vnpolyshed, and of pur­
pose lyke the rude and vnskylfull: 
Other in that leanes are trymme, 
that is somwhat floryshynge also 
and garnyshed. Cicero vsed thys 
kynde in hys philosophicall dispu­
tacions, in the oracion for Quincius 
for Roscius the Comedy plaier, & Te­
rence, & Plautus in their Comedies. 
Such as can not handsomly vse them 




selues in that mery conceyted slen­
dernes of wordes, fall into a drye 
and feble kynde of oracion.



The meane kynde. 
 
The mean and temperate kynd 
of indyghting standeth of the low­
er, and yet not of the loweste, and 
moste comen wordes and sentences. 
And it is ryghtly called the tempe­
rate kynde of speakyng, because it 
is very nygh vnto the small, and to 
the greate kynde, folowyng a mo­
deracion and temper betwyxt them. 
And it foloweth as we saye in one 
tenour, distinguyshyng all the ora­
cion wyth small ornamentes both 
of wordes, and sentences. Cicero v­
seth thys for the lawe of Manili­
us, for Aulus Cecinna, for Marcus 
Marcellus, and moste of all in hys 
bookes of offices. In this it is fau­
tye to come to the kynd that is nye 
vnto it, whyche is called dissolute, 
because it waueth hyther and thy­
ther, as it were wythout senowes 
and ioyntes, standyng surely in no 
poynte. And suche an oracion can 
not cause the hearer to take anye 
heede, when it goeth so in and out, 




and comprehendeth not any thyng 
wyth perfecte wordes



Of Schemes and Tropes. 



Scheme

Scheme is a Greke worde, and 
signifyeth properlye the maner of 
gesture that daunsers vse to make, 
when they haue won the best game, 
but by translacion is taken for the 
fourme, fashion, and shape of anye 
thynge expressed in wrytynge or 
payntinge: and is taken here now 
of vs for the fashion of a word, say­
ynge, or sentence, otherwyse wryt­
ten or spoken then after the vulgar 
and comen vsage, and that thre sun­
dry waies: by figure, faute, vertue.


Figure. 

Fygure, of Scheme the fyrst part, 
is a behaueoure, maner, or fashion 
eyther of sentence, oracion, or wor­
des after some new wyse, other then 
men do commenlye vse to wryte or 
speake: and is of two sortes. Dia­
noias, that is of sentence, and Lex­
eos of worde. 

Figure of Dianoias, or sen­
tence, because it properlye belon­
geth to oratoures, we wyll speake 
of it hereafter in place conuenient,
 




now wyll we entrete of the figure 
Lexeos, or of worde, as it pertey­
neth to the Gramarians.


Figure of worde. 

Figure Lexeos, or of worde, is 
when in speakyng or wrytyng any 
thynge touchynge the wordes is 
made newe or straunge, otherwyse 
then after the comen custume: & is of 
ii. kyndes, diccion, & construccion.


Figure of Diccion. 

Figure of diccion is the transfor­
macion of one word, either written 
or pronounced: & hath these partes.



Prosthesis.

Appositio , apposicion, the putting 
to, eyther of letter or sillable at the 
begynnyng of a worde, as: He all 
to bewretched hym.



Apheresis

Ablatio , the takynge awaye of a 
letter or sillable from the begyn­
nynge of a worde, of a letter, when 
we say: The penthesis of thys house 
is to low, for the epenthesis. Wher 
note this the word penthesis is a greke 
worde, & yet is vsed as an englishe, 
as many mo be, and is called a pen­
tis by these figures, Sincope and 
Apheresis, the whole word beynge 
as is before, epenthesis, so called be­

The kyndes bee these: obscure, in­
ordinate, barbarous.

the whole matter is all alyke, and 
hath no varietie to auoyde tedious­
nes, as: He came thither to the bath, 
yet he saide afterwardes. Here one 
seruant bet me. Afterwardes he 
sayde vnto hym: I wyll consider. 
Afterwardes he chyd wyth hym, & 
cryed more and more when manye 
were presente. Such a folyshe tel­
lyng of a tale shall you heare in ma­
ny simple & halfe folyshe persons.

or leude folowyng; when the wytte 
lacketh iudgement, and fondlye fo­
lowyng a good maner of speaking, 
runne into a faute, as when affec­
tyng copy, we fall into a vaine bab­
 




lynge, or laboryng to be brief, wax 
bare & drye. Also if we shuld saye: a 
phrase of building, or an audience of

monge the leaste.

pyng together of wordes of diuerse 
languages into one speche: as of 
Frenche, welche, spanyshe, into en­
glyshe: and an vsynge of wordes be 
they pure or barbarous. And al­
though great authors somtyme in 
long workes vse some of these fau­
tes, yet must not their examples be 
folowed, nor brought into a common 
vsage of speakyng.



Barbarie and hys partes.


Barbarie  is a faute, whych tur­
neth the speche from his purenes, and 
maketh it foule and rude, and the 
partes be these.






Barbaris­
mus.

Barbarismus  is, when a worde 
is either naughtely wrytten or pro­
nounced contrary to the ryght law & 
maner of speakinge. And it is done 
by addicion, detraccion, chaunging, 
transposynge, eyther of a letter, a 
syllable, tyme, accent, or aspiracion. 
Hereof we haue shewed exampels 
partly wher they be called figures, 
and partly, doute ye not, but both 
the speakynge and wrytyng of bar­
barouse men, wyll gyue you inow. 
Hytherto be referred the fautes of 
euil pronouncing certein letters, & 
of tomuch gapyng, or contrarye of 
speakyng in the mouth.



Solecismus.

Inconueniens structura , is an vn­
mete and vnconuenient ioynynge 
together the partes of spech in con­
struccion, whych is marked by all 
thynges that belong to the partes 
of speche: as when one parte is put 
for another, when gender for gen­
der, case for case, tyme for tyme, 
mode for mode, number for num­
ber, aduerbe for aduerbe, preposi­
cion for preposicion: whych because 
it is vsed of famous authores, in 
stede of fautes, be called figures.






Vertue. 
Vertue, or as we saye, a grace & 
dygnitye in speakynge, the thyrde 
kynde of Scheme, is when the sen­
tence is bewtyfied and lyfte vp a­
boue the comen maner of speaking 
of the people. Of it be two kyndes: 
Proprietie, and garnyshyng.

Proprietie and his partes. 
Proprietie, is when in wryting 
and pronunciacion ther be no fau­
tes committed, but thynges done 
as they shulde be. The partes bee 
proposicion, and accenting.



Analogia.

Proportio , proporcion is, where­
by the maner of true wrytynge is 
conserued. By thys the barbarous 
tonge is seperated from the verye 
true and naturall speche, as be the 
fyne metals from the grosser. To 
speke is no lawe, but an obserua­
cion or markyng, not leanyng vpon 
cause, but vpon example. For in e­
loquence, the iudgement of excellent 
men standeth for reason, as saythe 
Quintilian in hys fyrst boke.



Tasis.

Extensio , is that wherby a swete 
and pleasaunt modulacion or tuna­ 




blenes of wordes is kepte, because 
some are spoken wyth a sharpe te­
nure or accent, some wyth a flatte, 
some strayned out. This grace spe­
cially perteineth to a turnyng of the 
voyce in pleasaunte pronunciacion.


Garnyshyng and his kyndes. 

Garnishyng as the word it selfe 
declareth, is when the oracion is gay­
lye set oute and floryshed with diuerse 
goodly figures, causyng much plea­
sauntnes and delectacion to the hea­
rer: and hath two kyndes, compo­
sicion, and exornacion.



Sinthesis.

Composicion  is an apte settinge 
together of wordes, whych causeth 
all the partes of an oracion to bee 
trymmed al alyke. And in it muste 
be considered that we so order our 
wordes, that the sentence decrease 
not by puttynge a weaker word af­
ter a stronger, but that it styl go vp­
warde and increase. There is also 
a naturall order, as to saye: men & 
women, daye and nyght, easte, and 
weste, rather then backewardes. 

In thys muste be auoyded also to 
often comyng together of vowels, 
which make the oracion wyde and 




gapyng. To muche repetyng of all 
one letter in the beginning of wor­
des, to much repeting of one word, 
and that they ende not to much all 
alyke, that the sentence be not held 
on to longe, which werieth the hea­
rer, and the speaker: nor that ma­
nye consonantes run not to harshely 
together, wyth many other, which 
Cicero speaketh of in hys thyrde 
booke of hys oratour, and Quinti­
lian in hys nynth, wherof here to 
put examples were to longe.

"Synthesis" antedates the earliest OED citation (1611).




Exornacion  is a fyne polyshinge 
of wordes and sentences by disseue­
ryng them with diuerse goodly colours 
and tropes or chaungings of speach.



Tropes.


Emonge authors manye tymes 
vnder the name of figures, Tropes 
also be comprehended:  Neuerthe­
lesse ther is a notable difference be­
twixt them. In figure is no alteraci­
on in the wordes from their proper 
significacions, but only is the ora­
cion & sentence made by them more ple­
asaunt, sharpe & vehement, after the affec­
cion of him that speketh or writeth: 
to the which vse although tropes al­
so do serue, yet properlye be they so 




called, because in them for necessi­
tye or garnyshynge, there is a mo­
uynge and chaungynge of a worde 
and sentence, from theyr owne sig­
nificacion into another, whych may 
agre wyth it by a similitude. The 
former parties ben these.



Metaphora.

Translatio , translacion, that is a 
worde translated from the thynge 
that it properlye signifieth, vnto a­
nother whych may agre with it by 
a similitude. And amonge all ver­
tues of speche, this is the chyefe. 
None perswadeth more effecteous­
lye, none sheweth the thyng before 
oure eyes more euidently, none mo­
ueth more mightily the affeccions, 
none maketh the oracion more good­
lye, pleasaunt, nor copious. 

Translacions be diuerse. 


i.


Some from the body to the mynd, 
as: I haue but lately tasted the He­
brue tonge, for newely begunne it. 
Also I smell where aboute you go, 
for I perceyue. 


ii.

From the reasonable to the vnre­
sonable, as Vyrgill in hys Geor­
gere applyed the counselles and 
fashion of warres belongynge to 




men, to bees. 


iii.

From the vnreasonable to the re­
sonable. What whinest thou? what 
chatterest thou? That one taken of 
a wolfe, that other of a pye. 


iiii.

From the liuinge to the not li­
uyng. The mouthe of the well, the 
fatnes of the earth. The lande wyl 
spewe them oute. 


v.

From the not lyuynge to the li­
uyng. Cicero florisheth in eloquence. 


vi.

From the liuyng, to the liuynge. 
The iews winched against Moses. 


vii.

From the not liuinge to the not 
liuynge. The wordes flowe oute of 
hys mouth. He is good for a grene 
wounde.



Catachresis.

Abusio , when for a certeyne and 
proper worde, we abuse a lyke, or 
that is nie vnto it, as when we say: 
longe counsel, lytle talke, smal mat­
ter. Here maye we soone perceyue 
that by abusion wee take wordes 
that be somwhat nye, whych pro­
perly do belong to vnlyke thinges.
"Catachresis" antedates the earliest OED citation (1589).




Metalepsis.

Transsumptio , Transsumpcion, is 
when by degrees we go to that that is 
shewed as: he hyd hym selfe in the 
blacke dennes. By blacke, is vnder­
 




stand ful of darkenes & consequent­
ly stepe downe, and verye depe.



Metonomia

Metonomya , Transnominacion, 
when a worde that hathe a proper 
significacion of hys owne, beynge 
referred to another thing, hath ano­
ther: & this is done diuerse waies. 


i.

When the chiefe master or doar 
of a thyng is put for the thing it self, 
as: Put vpon you the Lorde Iesus 
Christ. Also: You play Iudas with me 


ii.

When the place, or that that con­
teineth, is put for the thyng that is 
in it, as: All the round earthe pray­
seth God. Oxforth (some say) hath 
not forsaken all popery, for the stu­
dentes therin. 


iii.

When that that is conteyned is 
put for that that doth conteine, as: 
The fryer Austens is goodly buyl­
ded, for the house wher the fryers wer. 


iiii.

When the doer is put for that that 
is done, as: God brought the Isra­
elites out of Egypte wyth a stret­
ched out arme, and stronge hande. 
Also: Is gods hand drawen in? for 
power and strength. 


v.

When that is done is put for the doer.
"Transnomination" antedates the earliest OED citation (1561).




Synecdoche

Intellectio , Intelleccion when one 




thyng is vnderstand by another that 
is of the same maner and kynd, and 
this is done many wayes. 


i.

When bi the whole is vnderstand 
a parte, as: Abraham set a calfe be­
fore them, for calues fleshe. 


ii.

By a parte the whole, as: He re­
ceyued the straungers vnder the suc­

By one many, as: The Frenche­
man in the batail had the ouerthrow. 


iiii.

By a kynd the general, as: If thou

By the general the kynd: Eue the 
mother of al liuing things, for of al 
men: Preach to al creaturs, to al men. 


vi.

By that goeth before, the thynge 
that foloweth, as: Defer hys spur­
res to hys horse, for he rode a pace, 
or fled faste awaye. 


vii

By that that foloweth, the thinge 
wente before, as: I got it wyth the 
swete of my face, for with my labour. 


viii.

By the matter, the thynge that is 
made of it, as: Fleshe and bloude 
shewed the not it. 


ix.

By the signe, the thyng that is signified 




as: Lo, now the toppe of the chym­
neyes in the villages smoke a farre 
of: wherby Vyrgyl signifieth night 
to be at hande.



Pronominia­
cio.

Antonomasia , is, whych for the pro­
per name putteth some other word
As the Archebyshop confuted the 
errour, for Cranmer. The Philoso­
pher lyed that the worlde was eter­
nall, for Aristotle. The Apostle say­
eth wee be iustified by faythe, for 
Paule.
"Antonomasia" antedates the earliest OED citation (1553).




Periphrasis.

Circuicio , is a larger descripcion 
eyther to garnyshe it, or if it bee 
foule to hyde it, or if it be bryefe to 
make it more playn: by etimology, 
by sygnes, by definicion 
Example of the fyrste. The proui­
dence of Scipio, ouerthrew the might 
of Carthago. Here saue onlye for 
garnyshyng sake he myghte haue 
sayde playnlye: Scipio ouerthrew 
Carthage: Of the nexte. When 
Saule was doyng his busines, Da­
uid might haue killed hym. Doyng 
hys busines, ye wot what it mea­
neth. Of the thyrd, you haue the lar­
ger exposicions vpon the Gospels 
called by the name of thys figure. 




By Etymologie or shewyng the 
reason of the name. Well maye he be 
called a parasite, for a parasite is 
the loueth other because of his meat. 

By sygnes, as: when by certeine 
notes we describe anye thynge, as 
if a man understandyng anger wyll 
saye that it is the boylynge of the 
mynde, or color, whych bryngeth in 
palenes into the countenaunce, fierse­
nes in the eies, and tremblyng in the

Epanaphora

Repeticio , repeticion, when in 
lyke and diuerse thynges, we take 
our begynnyng continually at one & 
the selfe same word, thus: To you 
this thyng is to be ascribed, to you 
thanke is to be geuen, to you thys 
thynge shal be honour. In this ex­
ornacion is much pleasantnes, gra­
uitie, and sharpnes, & it is much v­
sed of al oratours & notably setteth 
oute, and garnysheth the oracion.
"Epanaphora" antedates the earliest OED citation (1678).




Antistrophe.

Conuersio , conuersion is whych 
taketh not hys begynnynges at al

one worde styll closeth vp the sen­
tence, & it is contrary to that other 
before, as: Sence the time that concord

"Antistrophe" antedates the earliest OED citation (1605).




Symploce.

Complexio , complexion compriseth 
both two exornacions, both this, & 
that whych we declared before, that 
both all one fyrste worde shulde be 
often repeted, & we shuld turne often 
to all one laste word, as: Who toke 
Sidechias prisoner, & put out both 




hys eyes? Nabuchodonozer. Who 
put Daniell and hys felowes into

darest thou come into oure syghte?

Epanodus.

Traduccio , Traduccion is, why­
che maketh that when all one word 
is oftentymes vsed, that yet it doth 
not onlye not displease the mynde, 
but also make the oracion more trim 
in this wyse: Suffer ryches to be­
longe to riche men but prefer thou 
vertue before ryches: For if thou wylt 
compare ryches wyth vertue, thou 
shalte scarse thynke them meete to 
be called ryches, whych at but hand 




maydens to vertue. Also, we are vn­
to God the swete sauour of Christ. 
To the one part are we the sauour 
of death vnto deathe, and vnto the 
other part are we the sauour of lyfe 
vnto lyfe. ii. Cor. ii.



Sinonimia

Nominis communio , communion of 
the word, when we renewe not the 
selfe same worde by rehearsyng a­
gayn, but chaunge that that is put 
wyth an other word of the same va­
lewe, thus: Thou hast ouerthrow­
en the comon wealth euen from the 
foundacion, and cast downe the ci­
tye, euen from the roote. The iuste 
man shall floryshe as the palme tre, 
and shall be multiplyed as the Ce­
der tre. Cicero for Q. Ligarius. 
Whose syde wolde that poynte of 
thy swerd haue pricked? what mea­
ned thy weapons? what was thy 
mynde? what meante thyne eyes? 
handes, that burning of thy mynd? 
what desiredst thou? what wyshedste 
thou? Lytle differeth thys figure 
from the other before, only because 
the wordes be chaunges, the sentence 
remayning.






Sinathris­
mus.

Frequentacio , frequentacion is, 
when the thynges that be dispersed 
thorowout all the cause, are gathe­
red together into one place, that the 
oracion shulde be the wayghtier, & 
rebukefuller, thus: What faute is 
he without? why shuld you O Iud­
ges be mynded to deliuer hym? He 
is an harlot of hys owne bodye, he 
lyeth in wayte for others, gredy, in­
temperate, wanton, proud, vnnatu­
ral to his parentes, vnkynd to hys 
frindes, troubleous to hys kynse­
folke, stubburn to hys betters, dys­
daynful to his equals, cruel to hys 
inferiours, finally, intollerable to 
all men.

che sheweth the significacion of so­
rowe, or of anger, by callyng vpon

hope of men, and frayle fortune: & 
our vayne contencions, whych often 
tymes are broken in the myd way, 
rushe downe, and in the fal ar quite 
ouerthrowen before they can se the 
hauen. Hereunto belongeth expecta­
cion, obtestacion, wishyng, rebuking.

Obtestacio , obtestacion, when for

helpe you receiued me agayne.

before?

"Epiplexis" antedates the earliest OED citation (1678).





Erotesis.

Interrogacio , Euerye interro­
gacion is not of grauity, neither yet 
a Scheme, but thys whyche when 




those thinges be rehearsed vp whi­
che hurte oure aduersaryes cause, 
strengthneth that thynge that is 
gone before, thus seynge then that 
he spake all these wordes, and dyd 
all these thynges, whether dyd he 
put away our felowes myndes from 
the common wealthe or not?

"Erotesis56" antedates the earliest OED citation (1656).





Erotema.

Raciocinatio , raciocinacion is, 
by the whych we our selues axe a 
reason of our selfe, wherefore eue­
rye thynge shulde be spoken, & that 
oftentymes we demaund of our sel­
ues a declaracion of euery proposi­
cion after thys maner: Thys was 
well ordeined of oure elders to de­
pryue no kynge of hys lyfe whome 
they had taken in batayl. Why so? 
for the power whyche fortune had 
geuen vs, it to consume in the pu­
nyshement of them whom the same 
fortune a lytle before had set in hy­
este degree, were agaynste reason. 
Yea but he brought a greate army 
agaynst you? I wyl not remember 
it. Why so? For it is the poynte of 
a valiaunte man, such as contend 
for the vyctorye, them to counte ene­
myes: suche as be ouercome, those 




to count men: so that fortitude maye 
diminishe war, humanitie increase 
peace. But he if he had ouercome, 
wolde he haue done so? Verelye he 
wolde not haue bene so wyse. Why 
shulde ye spare hym then? because 
such foly I am wont to despise, not 
to folowe.

"Erotema" antedates the earliest OED citation (1589).





Prosapodo­
sis.

Subiectio , when we axe of oure 
selfe what can be saide agaynst vs, 
and answere to our selues thus: 
Shall we tary in synne? God for­
byd. Or compell our aduersarye to 
answer thus: O Iewes, what can 
you say for denyall of Christe. Wyl 
you saye that you haue not youre 
Messias? but your prophets say the 
contrarye. Your Types are confoun­
ded. Whom wyl you be iudged by? 
by Hystories? Oures declare that 
you be out of the way, & shall come 
agayne to Christ.



Antiphora.

Tacite obiectioni responsio. When 
we make answere to a thynge that 
myght priuely be obiected agaynst 
vs, as in the fyrst epystle of Ouide, 
Penelope wylling her husband V­
lysses to come home hymselfe, and 
wryte nothyng vnto her. Wher he 




myght haue layed for hys tarying 
the warres, she priuely toke awaye 
the excuse, saying: Troy is destroied.



Aporia.

Dubitatio , dubitacion, when wee 
doute of two thynges, or of many, 
whych we shuld inespecially speke 
of. Much hurted the common wealth 
at that tyme, whether I shuld saye 
the folyshenesse of the consulles, or 
the malyce, or bothe, I can not tell.

"Aporia" antedates the earliest OED citation (1589).





Apophasis.

Expeditio , expedicion, when ma­
ny reasons rehearsed vp, wherby a 
thynge myghte be done or not, the 
other are taken away, and one left 
that we entende, thus: It muste 
needes bee that thys controuersie 
touching the sacrament must stand 
eyther vpon the much pressyng and 
rigour of the wordes, or vpon the 
meanynge and vnderstandynge of 
them. The wordes as they stande, 
brynge wyth them greate inconue­
nience, to wytte, to expositoures, 
and the other textes. The meaning 
doth not so, but auoydeth al these in­
conueniences, & satisfieth reason, ex­
positours, & texts of the scripture: 
wherfore wyt, expositour, & scrip­
ture thinketh it better to take the 
sentence, then the worde.

"Apophasis" antedates the earliest OED citation (1656).








Epilogus.

Conclusio , conclusion is, which by 
a brief argumentacion of these thin­
ges that be spoken before or done, 
inferreth that thynge that necessa­
rilye shulde folowe, thus: And if 
a reuelacion wer geuen to the Tro­
ianes, that Troy myght not be taken 
without the arowes of Philectetes, 
and thei did nothing else but strike 
Alexander to kyl him that in dede 
was Troy to be taken.



Epitrope.

Permissio , permission, when we 
shew that we geue & graunt any thyng 
altogether to a mans wyll, thus: 
Because al thynges taken away, on­
ly is left vnto me my body & mynd, 
these thynges, whych only at leste 
vnto me of many, I graunte them to 
you and to your power.

"Epitrope" antedates the earliest OED citation (1656).





Anacinosis.

Communicacio , communicacion is, 
when we leaue sumwhat to the Iud­
ges to be estemed, thus: I leaue vn­
to you o iudges to be thought what 
hurt the common welth shal take hereof



Dialisis.

Diuisio , diuision is which diuiding 
one thyng from another, endeth them 
both by shewing a reason, thus: why 
shuld I lay ani thing to thi charge? 
if thou bee good, thou hast not deserued 




it, if thou be naught, thou carest not 
for it. Also, what shuld I speake of 
myne owne good turnes towarde 
the. If thou do remember them, I 
shuld but trouble you: If you haue 
forgotten them, when by deede I 
haue profited nothyng, what good 
can I do in wordes?



Antitheton.

Contentio , contencion, when the 
reason standeth by contrary wordes 
or contraries be rehearsed by compa­
rison, thus: Flattery hath pleasaunt 
begynnynges, but the same hathe 
verye bytter endynges. Cicero a­
gaynst Catiline: when they coulde 
not lyue honestlye, they had rather 
dye shamefully. They that be after 
the fleshe, care for these thynges that 
be of the fleshe. They that be after 
the spirite, care for the thynges of 
the spirite.



Antithesis.

Contrarium , contrary is, that of 
two diuerse thynges confirmeth the 
one bryefely and easelye, thus: For 
he that alwayes wyll be an enemy 
to hys owne rekenyngs, how shuld 
a man trust that he wold be a frind 
to other mens matters? He that in 
familiare communicacion and com­ 




pany of hys friendes wyl neuer say 
truth, thinkest them that he wil absteine 
from a lye in a common audience.



Colon.

Membrum oracionis , a member of 
the reason is so called when a thinge 
is shewed perfitely in fewe wordes 
the whole sentence not shewed, but 
receyued agayne with an other parte, 
thus: Thou dyddest bothe profite 
thyne enemie, and hurte thy frynd. 
Thys exornacion may be made of 
two partes only, but the perfiteste 
is made of thre, thus: Thou diddest 
profite thine enemy, hurt thi frind, 
and dydst no good to thy selfe.

"Colon" antedates the earliest OED citation (1589).





Dialyton.

Articulus , article is, when eche 
word is set a sunder by cutting the 
oracion thus. By sharpnes, voyce, 
countenaunce, thou madeste thyne 
enemyes afrayd. Thou destroyedst 
thyne enemyes wyth enuye, wron­
ges, power, falsehead.



Isocolon.

Compar , euen or equall, is when 
the oracion hath in it the partes of 
the whyche we spake before, & that 
they be made of euen number of sil­
lables: but thys equalitie must not 
stand by numbryng of them, but by 
perceyuyng of it in the mynd. Christe 




afore the Iudge was led, & on hys 
head a croune of thorne was putte, 
in token that in dede, the kynge of 
Iews he was borne. Here be some 
mo wordes in on member then in an 
other, yet sound they to the eare of 
lyke lengthe.



Homioptoton

Similiter cadens , fallyng al alike 
is, when in the same construcci­
on of wordes ther be two wordes 
or mo which be spoken alyke in the 
selfe same cases, thus: Thou pray­
sest a man nedye of vertue, plente­
ful of money. Cicero for Flaccus: 
There is in them no varietie of opini­
on, none of wyll, none of talke.

"Homioptoton" antedates the earliest OED citation (1678)).





Homoteleto.

Similiter desinens , endynge al a­
lyke, when words or sentences haue 
alyke endyng, as: Thou dareste do 
fylthely, and studiest to speke bau­
dely. Content thy selfe with thy state, 
in thy herte do no man hate, be not 
the cause of stryfe and hate.



Climax.

Gradacio , is when we rehearse a 
gain the word that goth next before, & 
destend to other thinges by degrees 
thus: To Affrican industry gat ver­
tue, vertue glory, glory hatered.



Orismus.

Definicio , definicion, wherby the pro­
 




per effect of any thynge is declared 
briefely & absolutely in this wyse: 
This is not diligence but couetous­
nes, because the diligence is a nedy sa­
uing of thine own: couetousnes is 
a wrongful desyre of othermens.



Metabasis.

Transicio , transicion is, wherby brief­
ly we monyshe what hath ben spo­
ken, & what may folowe, as: What 
he hath ben to hys contrey I haue 
told, now ye shal hear how he hath 
shewed him self to hys parentes. Al­
so Cicero for the law of Manilius: 
Because we haue spoken of the kind 
of the warre, now wyll we shewe a 
fewe thynges of the greatnes of it.



Paralepsis.

Occupatio , occupacion is, when we 
make as though we do not knowe, 
or wyl not know of the thyng that wee 
speke of most of al, in this wyse: I 
wyl not say that thou tokest money of 
our felowes, I wyl not stand much 
in thys that thou robbedst kingdoms, 
cityes, and al mens houses: I passe 
ouer thy theftes, & al thy rauyns.



Asindeton.

Dissolutio , when the oracion lacketh 
coniunccions, thus: Obey thy paren­
tes, be ruled by thi kinsfolke, folow 
thy fryndes, obey the lawes.
"Asyndeton" antedates the earliest OED citation (1589).







Apostrophe.

Auersio , auersion, when we turne 
our speche from them to whom we 
dyd speake to another personne, ey­
ther present or absent, or to a thing 
to the whych we fayne a person, as 
a precher, speaking of priestes, that 
feede not the flocke, may fytly turn 
hys speche vnto Peter, sayinge: O 
Peter, I wold thou liuedst, & saw­
est what thy brethren do, howe far 
they be gone from that thou prescri­
bedst them to do. Againe: O world, 
howe pleasant be the thynges that 
thou dost promyse, how bytter ben 
they that thou geuest.



Anangeon.

Necessum , necessitie, when we con­
fesse the thynge to be done, but ex­
cuse it by necessitye, eyther of the per­
son or tyme, thus: I confesse that 
thys I dyd. But the woman that 
thou gauest me, dyd deceyue me. 
Also, somtyme I was in that opi­
nion, but the tyme so required.



Anaclasis.

Refractio , that is the turninge 
backe agayne of a worde into a con­
trary significacion, thus: I knowe 
kynge Ezechias that all thys lyfe 
is but bitternes, but I praye thee 
gyue me suche bytternes.
"Anaclasis" antedates the earliest OED citation (1784) but also has a quite different sense.







Bomphiolo­
gia.

Verborum bombus , when small & 
triflyng thynges are set out wyth 
great gasyng wordes. Example of 
this haue you in Terence of the boa­
sting souldiar, & creping smel feast.



Miosis.

Diminutio , when greate matters 
are made lyghte of by wordes, as 
when he was wel beaten bi a knaue, 
that knaue wyll saye he dyd but a 
lytle stryke hym.



Liptote.

Extenuatio , the makyng lesse of a 
thynge to auoyde arrogance, thus: 
If I haue any wit O Iudges, if a­
ny exercyse of endyghtyng, al may 
I thanke Archias the Poete of. 
Cicero for Archias.

"Liptote" antedates the earliest OED citation (1589).





Diasirmus.

Eleuacio , when we make lyghte 
of, and dyspyse great argumentes 
brought agaynst vs, whych to aun­
swer vnto it is labour, and we saye 
they perteyne not to the purpose, 
or that they are vnworthy to be an­
swered vnto, or that we kepe them 
tyll another tyme: Of thys ther ne­
deth none example







AS oute of lytle springs 
ariseth greate fluddes: 
so now these preceptes 
of grammer finyshed, 
and the fyrste order of 
the Rethorical figures: We nowe 
come vnto that greate declaracion 
of eloquence, called of Quintilian & 
Cicero, the ornamentes of sentence.

Figures of sentence.



Particio.

Particion  called also diuision & 
distribucion rethoricall, is when a 
thing that mai be generally spoken, 
is more largely declared, and diui­
ded into partes. Example: He is 
perfitely seene in all the sciences. 
This sentence spoken as it were in a 
summe, may be enlarged, if seuerally 
you reherse vp al the kindes of lear­
ning. There is no kynd of doctrine 
at al but he is exquisitely sene in it. 
There is no science, but he hathe 
learned it thorowly, and so learned 
it, that you wolde thynke he had la­
bored onely in it. So maruelouslye 
he knoweth all the fables of al the 
Poetes, he so aboundeth in the 
floures of the Rethoricians: He 
hath so boulted oute the paynefull 




rules of the gramarians. So per­
fitely knoweth he the subtilnesse of 
the Logicians, and hath so soughte 
oute the priuities of natural thyn­
ges, and ouercome the harde poyn­
tes of supernaturall wisedome: he 
hathe passed thorowe the secretes 
of the diuines, and hath thorowlie 
perceyued the mathematical demon­
stracions. He so knoweth the mo­
cions of the starres, the reasons of 
numbers, the measurynges of the 
earth, the situacions, names & spa­
ces of cities, mountaynes, fluddes, 
and fountaynes, he so knoweth the 
difference and harmonies of tunes: 
He so remembreth all hystoryes olde 
and late: So knoweth all good au­
thors, all antiquities & nouelties, 
and also is perfitelye well seene as 
wel in Greke as latyne. Finallye 
whatsoeuer learnynge hathe bene 
found and taught of good authors, 
al that thorowlie hath he percey­
ued, knowen and remembred. Here 
these wordes, he is perfitelye seene 
in all the sciences, bee declared in 
theyr partes.



Enumeracio

Enumeracion  is much lyke vn­
to thys, when not beynge contente 





Enumeracion
of thynges
that go before

at once to declare the ende of the 
matter, we rehearse vp all that went 
before it was done. Example: Cice­
ro oppressed the mischeuous purpo­
ses of Catiline. Thus maye you set 
it forth: The myscheuous enterpry­
ses of Catiline by most vngracious 
yonge men, whych went about the 
destruccion of the citie of Rome, M 
Tullius the consull dyd quickelye 
smell out by hys foresyghte, and by 
hys singuler vigilancye sought them 
oute, by his hyghe prudence espyed 
them, by his incredible eloquence 
conuinced them, and by hys graue 
authoritie repressed them, by force of 
armes subdued them, & with great 
happines toke them quyte awaye. 

Hitherto also apperteineth, when 
we expound a thyng not barely, but 

Enumeracion
of the causes.

repete the causes also sumwhat be­
fore, and of what begynnynges it 
came of. As if not contente to haue 
sayd, that the Frenchmen made ba­
taile with the Neapolitans, we re­
hearse also what wer the causes of 
theyr stryfe, who was the setter for­
ward, and what was the occasion 
of the warre, what hope and truste 




eyther of them had to the victorye. 
Of these ar many examples in Sa­
luste & Liuie. From thys differeth 

Enumeracion
of effectes, &
consequences.

not when we do not simplye shewe 
forthe the matter, but reherse also 
those thynges that eyther go with 
it, or folowe it, as thus: We thanke 
the of thys warre. Thus maye you 
dilate the matter. The treasure 
spente vpon the Barbariens, the 
youthe broken wyth laboures, the 
corne troden downe, the cattel dri­
uen awaye, stretes and vyllages e­
uery where set on fyre, fieldes lefte 
desolate, walles ouerthrowen, hou­
ses robbed, temples spoyled, so ma­
ny olde men chylderles, so manye 
orphanes, so manye wyddowes, so 
many virgins shamefully defiled, the 
maners of so many yong men made 
worse by leude liberty, so many men 
slayne, so great mourning, so many 
good artes loste, lawes oppressed, 
religion blotted, al thynges of god 
and man confounded, all good or­
der of the citie corrupted: I say all 
this heape of myschiefs that riseth 
of war, we mai thanke the only of it, 
which wast the beginner of this war






Euergia.

Enargia , euidence or perspicui­
tie called also descripcion rethori­
call, is when a thynge is so descri­
bed that it semeth to the reader or 
hearer that he beholdeth it as it were 
in doyng. Of thys figure ben many 
kyndes.


The fyrste, called effiguracion 
or descripcion of a thynge, where­
by the figure and forme of it is set 
out: as of the vniuersall flud.

"Effiguration" not found in OED.




The seconde, the descripcion of 
a personne, when a man is descri­
bed, as are the noble menne in Plu­
tarch, and the Emperours in Sue­
tonius. Howe be it the rethorici­
anes vse thys worde Prosopopeia, 
that is descripcion of a personne 
to comprehende the sixe kyndes fo­
lowinge.



Charactirs­
mus.The thyrde kinde is called Cha­
ractirismus , that is the efficcion or 
pycture of the bodye or mynde, as 
Dauus described Crito, & Mino 
describeth Demea.

"Effiction" antedates the earliest OED citation (1656).





Prosopogra­
phia.

The .iiii is the fainyng of a person 
called Prosopographia, and is of .ij 
sorts. Fyrst the descripcion of a fained 




person, as Vyrgyl in the syxt of E­
neid, faineth Sibil to be mad, & fay­
neth the persons in hell. An other 
forme is when we fayne person, commu­
nicacion, or affecte of a man or of a 
beaste, to a dumme thynge, or that 
hath no bodye, or to a dead man: as 
to the Harpies, furies, deuils, slepe 
hongar, enuie, fame, vertue, iustice, 
and suche lyke, the poetes fayne a 
person, and communicacion. This 
seconde fashion the Poetes do call 
Prosopopey. The fyrst kind is called 

Aetopeia.

AEtopeia, that is an expression of ma­
ners or mylde affeccions, and hath 
thre kyndes: of the whych the fyrst 
is a significacion or expression of 
maners somewhat longer, as of 
wittes, artes, vertues, vices. Thus 
we expresse Thraso a boster, and 
Demea a sowre felowe.

The seconde forme, is an expres­
sion of naturall propensitie, and 
inclinacions to naturall affecci­
ons, as of the fathers loue toward 
the chyldren. &c. of fryendshyppe, 
neyghbourhod & cete. as you maye 
se in hystoryes. 




The thyrd kynde is the expression 
of lighter affeccions, as when wee 
go about by fayre meanes to gette 
the mery affeccions of meane to vs 
ward or to other, & when the mynd 
is lyft vp into hope, myrth, & laugh­
ter, and as be louyng salutations, 
promises, & communynges together 
in familiar epistles and dialogues, 
and the getting of loue and fauour 
in the begynnynges, and finallye 
thys figure doth teach, that Retho­
rique is a part of flattery. The sixt
kynde of rethoricall descripcion is 

Pathopeia.

 Pathopeia, that is expressyng of ve­
hement affeccions and perturbaci­
ons, of the whych ther be two sortes. 
 

The fyrste called Donysis , or inten­
cion, and some call it imaginacion, 
wherby feare, anger, madnes, hate­
red, enuye, and lyke other perturba­
cions of mynde is shewed and de­
scribed, as in Ciceros inuectiues.


Another forme is called Oictros , 
or commiseracion, wherby teares be 
pyked out, or pyty is moued, or for­
geuenes, as in Ciceros peroracions, 
and complaintes in Poets: And to 




be shorte ther is gotten no greater 
admiracion or commendacion of e­
loquence then of these two, AEtope­
ia, and Pathopeia, if they be vsed in 

dialogismus

place. The .vii. kind is Dialogismus  
whych is how often a short or long 
communicacion is fayned to a per­
son, accordyng to the comelines of 
it. Such be the concions in Liuie, & 
other historians. The .viii. kynd is 

Mimisis.

called Mimisis, that is a folowing 
eyther of the wordes or manoures 
whereby we expresse not onlye the 
wordes of the person, but also the 
gesture: and these foresayd sixe kin­
des Quintiliane dothe put vnder 
Prosopopeia. The .ix. kynde is the 
descripcion of a place, as of Car­
thage in the fyrst of Eneid. Referre 
hither Cosmographie and Geogra­
phie. The .x. kynd is called Topote­
sia , that is ficcion of a place, when 
a place is described such one perad­
uenture as is not, as of the fieldes 
called Elisii in Virgil: refer hither 
Atrothesiam, that is the descripcion 
of starres. The .xi. kinde is Chrono­, 




graphia, that is the descripcion of 
the tyme, as of nyght, daye, and the 
foure tymes of the yere. 



Amplificacio

A greate parte of eloquence is 
set in increasing and diminyshing, 
and serueth for thys purpose, that 
the thyng shulde seme as great as 
it is in dede, lesser or greater then it 
seemeth to manye. For the rude 
people haue commonly a preposte­
rous iudgement, and take the worst 
thynges for the beste, and the beste 
for the worst. Al amplificacion and 
diminucion is taken eyther of thin­
ges, or of wordes. Of thynges ryse 
effeccions, of words those fashions 
that nowe I wyll shewe. The first 
waye of increasyng or diminishing 
is by chaungynge the worde of the 
thynge, when in encreasynge we 
vse a more cruell worde, and a sof­
ter in diminyshynge, as when we 
call an euyll man a thiefe, and saye 
he hathe kylled vs, when he hathe 
beaten vs. And it is more vehemente 
if by correccion we compare grea­
ter wordes wyth those that we put 
before: As thou haste broughte not 
a thyefe, but an extorcioner, nor 




an adulterer, but a rauysher. &c.


Lyke vnto this is Hyperbole , why­
che saythe more then the truthe is 
in deede, as when we saye: The 
crye was hearde to heauen, mea­
nyng it was a greate crye. An o­
ther kynde is by increase, whyche 
is when the thynges goyng before 
beynge exaggerate, we come from 
them to the hyeste: As agaynste 
Verres. It is a myscheuous deede 
to bynde a Citizen of Rome, hay­
nous to beate hym, what? shall I 
saye to hange hym? An other waye 
of increase is, when wythoute dis­
tinccion in the context and course 
of the oracion, the circumstaunces 
sette in order, somewhat alwayes 
is added bygger then the fyrste, 
and that we come to the hyest by a 
swyfte pace. As he was not asha­
med to playe at dyce wyth iesters 
in the common cokerye, beynge a 
prieste, a Person, a Diuine, and a 
Monke. There is another kynde 
of amplyfienge that is by compa­
rison contrary to increase. For as 
in increase the thynges that go be­
fore beyng exaggerat, we go from 




them to the hyest, so comparison ta­
keth increase of the lesser, whych if 
they be greater in all mens opini­
ons, that must nedes appeare verie 
greate that we wyll haue amplifi­
co: And comparison is made by fic­
cion, & by puttynge to an example. 
By ficcion, eyther in one degree, or 
in many. As in the fyrst part of the 
amplifiyng of Antonies vomite, for 
he fayneth it had happened vnto 
hym at supper beyng but a priuate 
person. If at supper in these great 
bowles of thine thys happened vn­
to thee, who wolde not haue coun­
ted it a shame: But now in the syght 
of the people of Rome beynge a com­
mon officer, master of the horse, to 
whom it was shame once to belch, 
he wyth hys gobbets of meat that 
stanke al of wyne, fylled al his lap, 
and the iudgement seate. Here am­
plificacion is taken of smaller thin­
ges, and is made by one degree of 
many degrees, this maye be an ex­
ample. If a man gaue the euery yere 
xl. pound, woldest thou not thanke him? 
If a friend had redemed the out of 
prison with hys money, woldest thou 




not loue hym? If eyther in battell 
or shypwracke a man by hys vali­
antnes had saued the, woldest thou 
not worshyp hym as God, and saye 
thou were neuer able to make hym 
amendes? What ingratitude is it 
then that Christ God & man, which 
hathe made the, to whom thou dost 
owe al that thou hast, &c. so to dis­
pyse hym, so wyth dayely fautes to 
anger him, & for so great beniuolence 
to geue hym agayn so great contu­
melye and despyte? Neyther skyl­
leth it that we haue rehearsed ficci­
on and comparicion amonge argu­
mentes, for there is no cause why 
that amplificacion and ornacion 
shuld not be taken out of the same 
places from whence ther commeth 
probacion. Nor it is no newes 
the selfe same thynges to be apply­
ed to diuerse vses. As of all circum­
staunces both of the thyng, and of 
the person are taken argumentes, 
but euen oute of the selfe same are 
fet affeccions and exaggeracions, 
whych is manifest in the kynde de­
monstratiue: As when we prayse 
chastitie in a yonge man, we go not 




aboute to perswade that he was 
chaste, but that that vertue shulde 
appeare greater in floryshyng age. 
To lyke vse serue examples and si­
militudes, as in Esaye: The Oxe 
knewe hys owner, and the Asse the 
maunger of hys master, but Isra­
el hathe not knowen me. The ex­
ample of the Oxe & the Asse is not 
vsed for this to proue that the He­
brewes dyd not knowe their God, 
but that the impietie and folishnes 
of that nacion shulde be amplified. 
The same may be applied to profe 
after thys maner. If the Oxe and 
Asse knowledge theyr masters, of 
whom they are norished and do serue 
them, how much more conueniente 
is it, that man shuld knowledge hys 
maker and norisher, and serue him 
bothe in bodye and mynd. Contra­
rye, when Paul sayth: no man ser­
ueth in warre on his owne wages, 
be proueth by similitudes, that it 
is not comelye, that they that war 
vnder the gospell, shulde be compel­
led to be carefull for their liuynge. 
He shuld haue applied it to ampli­
fiyng, if he had propouned it thus. 




They that serue vnder a capteine 
be not careful for their liuyng, but 
lokinge for the sustenaunce of their 
capteine, only studye for thys to do 
hym faythful seruice, howe muche 
more shame is it that some menne 
that haue promised to fyght vnder 
Christ in the gospel, to distrust such 
a capteyne, and studye all they can 
to gather riches. Comparison by put­
tyng to example is, when by setting 
out as it were a lyke example, wee 
brynge to passe that that we exag­
gerate may be thought either very 
lyke, eyther equal, either bygger. 
And in this kynd both the whole is 
compared to the whole, & the partes 
to partes: as in the oracion of Ci­
cero for Milo. Did I pray you the no­
ble man Scipio being a priuat person 
kil Tiberius Gracchus whych sha­
ked the commom wealthe but a lytle, & 
shall wee beynge consulles suffer 
Catiline, that gothe aboute to wast 
the whole worlde wyth murther 
and fyre? Here bothe Catiline is 
compared to Gracchus, and the 
estate of the common wealthe to 
the whole world, & a lytle shakyng 




to slaughter, fyer and wastyng, and 
a priuate person to the consuls. 
Ther is an amplificacion also when 
contraries be set together, wherby 
bothe the partes seme bygger, and 
more euidente. As when exhorting 
men to liberalitie, we shewe howe 
foule a faute couetousenes is, that 
the foulnes of the faute being exag­
gerate, the goodlines of the vertue 
shulde be more encreased. There is 
another kynd of amplifiyng called 
reasonynge, when of those thinges 
that eyther folowe or go before, the 
hearer doth gather how great that 
thynge is that we wolde to be am­
plified. By thynges that go before, 
as when Homer armeth Achylles, 
or Hector to batayle, by the greate 
preparacion, we gather how sore the 
sight shal be. Of thinges that folowe: 
How much wyne Antony dranke, 
when that hauyng such a strong body 
he was not able to digeste it, but 
spewed it vp the nexte daye after. 
Of thynges ioyned to: as when Ma­
ro sayeth to Poliphemus: He had 
the bodye of a pineapple tree for a 
staffe in hys hande. Manye other 




kyndes ben there of amplifynge, 
which who so wyl se more at large, 
may read that right excellent boke 
of the famouse doctor Erasmus, 
whych be intituled the preacher. 



The inuencion of many proposi­
cions is, when the chyefe state or 
principal proposition of the cause is 
declared and proued by manye o­
ther proposicions and argumentes, 
so set in iuste order that there be no 
confusion of proposions. And pro­
posicions be taken partely of those 
that be common, and partly of those 
thynges that belonge properlye to 
the cause: As if a man wolde coun­
sell Tullye not to take the condi­
cion offered of Antony, that is, that 
by burnynge of hys bookes called 
philippia, he shulde haue hys lyfe, 
he myght vse commonly these pro­
posicions. Fyrste that no man oughte 
to by his life so dere, that therby he 
shulde lose hys immortall name. 
To thys generall may serue a per­
ticuler taken oute of circumstaun­
ces, that it oughte not to be done, 
inespecialy of Cicero, whych by so 
many laboures hathe gotten vnto 




hym selfe an excellente and euerla­
styng name, and that hath shewed 
moste eloquently by putting out so 
manye noble workes that deathe 
ought to be despised, inespeciallye 
seynge that now he hath not much 
tyme to lyue beynge an olde man. 
Agayn, another principall proposi­
cion shall be taken of the circumstaun­
ces. That nothynge is worse, then 
that Cicero beyng a very good man 
shulde owe his lyfe to Antonye the 
worst man of the world. The third 
proposicion shal be coniectural: how 
that Antony craftely goeth about 
that the bookes beynge burned, in 
the whych he perceiueth bothe hys 
owne immortal glory of Cicero, when 
he hath afterwardes taken awaye 
hys lyfe, he maye vtterlye extin­
guyshe Cicero.



¶ A copious heaping of probacions. 



Proues.

So when proposicions be found, 
remaineth argumentacion or proues, 
called in Greke Pistis, because they 
make suretye of a doutefull thyng. 

Two sortes
of proues.

Of proues some be artificiall, some 
vnartificial. Vnartificial be, fore­




iudgementes, rumoures, tormen­
tes, tabelles, othe, wytnesses, diui­
nacion, oracles. To these be refer­
red whych the Greekes cal Symeia 

Signes be re­
ferred to pro­
ues vnartifi­
cial, & whyt

or sygnes: For they also common­
lye are not set by the wytte of hym 
that disputeth, but are ministred 

Signes
wherfore.

otherwyse. They be called signes 
properlye, whyche rysynge of the 
thynge it selfe that is in question 

Signes be re­
ferred to

come vnder the sences of menne, as 
threatninges, whych be of the time 
that is paste, cryinge herde oute of 
a place, whyche is of the tyme pre­
sente, palenesse of hym whyche is 
axed of the murther, whyche is of 
the tyme folowynge, or that bloud

murther. Also of signes some bee 
necessary, as that he liueth whiche 
dothe breathe, and some probable, 
as bloude in the garmente, whych 
myghte also come oute of the nose, 

Proues taken
oute of circum­
staunces.

or otherwyse. Also proues and ar­
gumentes are taken oute of circum­
staunces, partly of the person, part­
lye of the cause or thyng it self, and 
be called also of the Rethoricians 





How proues
of circumstaun­
ces differ from
Aristotels
places.

places, neyther cleane contrarie to 
those that Aristotle hath taughte, 
neyther the very same: for some a­
gree wyth them, some be all one, 
and some diuerse. Onlye differeth 
the manour of teachynge, because 
the Rethoricianes do teache a pa­
trone, the philosopher generally 

Circumstauces
of person.

helpeth iudgement. Circumstaun­
ces of the person ben these. Kinred, 
nacion, contrey, kynde, age, bryng­
ynge vp, or discipline, hauioure of 
the body, fortune, condicion, nature 
of the mynde, studies, affectacion, 
wordes forespoken, & deedes done 
before, commocion, counsell, name. 
Kynred monisheth vs to consider of 

Kynred.

what progeny a man dothe come. 
For it is semely, and happeneth com­
monlye that the sonnes be lyke the 
forefathers, and thereof procedeth

credible is the accusacion of leche­
rye in a fayre body then in a foule, 
and violence more probable in the 
strong, then in the weake. Fortune 

Fortune

perteineth to ryches, kynred, frien­
des, seruitures, dignities, honours. 

Condicion.

Condicion comprehendeth manye 
thynges: as whether he be noble or 
not noble, an officer, or a priuate 
person, a father or a sonne, a citizen 
or a straunger, a fre man, or a ser­
uaunt, a maried manne, or a single 
man, a father or none, hauinge had 

The nature
of the mynd

but one wyfe, or two. The nature 
of the mynde hath manifold varie­
ties in men. Some be fearful, some 
strong, some gentle, some vehement, 
chaste, lecherous, glorious, modeste 

Studies

&c. Studies, for other be the ma­
ners of the rustical, then of the law­
yer, of the marchaunte, then of the 
Soldier, of the shipman then of the 
phisicion. To these they adde affec­

Affectacion.

tacion: For it skylleth muche what 
maner man euerye one wolde seme 




to be, whether he be the same or not: 
as ryche, or eloquent, iuste or migh­
tie, mery or sad, a fauorer of the peo­
ple, or of the great men. Both wor­
des that be spoken before time, and 

Wordes spo­
ken, & deedes
done before
Commocion

dedes that be done, be also conside­
red. For of thynges that be paste, 
the present be estemed, & also thin­
ges that be to come. Commocion in 
thys differeth from the nature of 
the mynde, because that one is per­
petuall, that other for a whyle: as 
anger is commocion, rancour the 
nature of the mynde, and feare a com­
mocion, fearefulnesse nature.

Name.

To these they adde the name of the 
person, of whence many tymes an 
argument is taken: as Cicero iesteth 
muche vpon Verres, or sweepers 
name, because beyng a strong thief, 
he swepte altogether. Thus haue 
we shewed that much matter may 
be taken of thynges belongyng to 
a personne, so maye be also of those 
that belonge to a thynge or cause, 
whiche places bee so handeled of 
Quintiliane, that he myngleth them 
wyth the places whyche Aristotle 
hathe comprehended in hys eyghte 




bookes of Topyckes. 



Circumstaun­
ces of things
be these.
Circumstan­
ces of the thynges be these: Cause, 
place, tyme, chaunce, facultie, in­
strumente, manour. And fyrste of e­
uerye thinge there be foure causes, 
efficient, materiall, formall and fi­
nall. Matter is the receptacle of al 
formes. The forme causeth it to be 
thys, and not another thynge: as 
the reasonable soule geueth to the 
body that it is a man, and the soule 
because it is a substaunce hathe her 
vnnamed forme, whereby she is a 


Fine or ende.


soule, and not an aungel. And what 
soeuer is made, is made to a certen 
ende, and one thynge maye haue di­
uerse endes: as nature hathe geuen 
brestes vnto women to geue milke, 
and also for comlynesse of theyr bo­
dies, neyther doth any man that is 
of a sounde mynde take vpon hym 
anye businesse, but for that he desy­
reth to haue some thynge: nor there 
is nothynge desyred, but under the 
consideracion of good or profite. 
So the ende whyche is laste in ef­
fecte, and fyrste in intencion, lo­
keth vpon the gettinge of profites, 
increase, and confirmacion of them, 




and also vpon them, eschuynge of 
disprofites, diminyshynge, or put­
tyng them awaye. But in chosyng 
them, false perswacion deceyueth 
manye, whylest by errour they be­
leue that to be good that is naughte. 
This place therfore serueth for ma­
ny thynges, to make more or lesse. 
Greatly happy shulde men be, if e­
uerye man wolde looke vpon the 
marke, not the whych desyre hathe 
sette before hym, but whyche God 
and honest reason hath prefixed. 
And of such strengthe is the ende, 
that hereof is taken the felicitie of 
euery thyng. To fast that the body 
maye obeye the mynde, to do good 
workes is an holy deede. To fast to 
be counted holye, is hypocrisie. To 
faste to encrease thy good, is coue­
tousenesse. To faste to be whole in 
thy bodie is phisycke, and so of prai­
ynge, almose, and other laudable 
workes. After lyke maner must be 
wayed the secondarie endes. An o­
ther circumstaunce of a thynge, is 

Place.

the place, whose qualitie often­
times maketh the faute either gre­
ter or lesser: as to steale an holye 




thing out of an holy place, is worse 
then some other kynde of theft. No 
lesse matter of argumentacion mi­
nistreth the qualitie of time, which 

Tyme.

signifieth two thynges. Fyrst it is 
taken playnly for the time present, 

Tyme hathe
two significa­
cions.

past, or to come: Seconde it signifi­
eth oportunitie to do a thynge, and 
so when a man cometh as we wold 
haue it, we saye he cometh in time. 
And in the seuenth of Ihon, when 
Christ sayth: My tyme is not yet 
come, tyme is taken for oportuni­
tie of tyme. And lykewyse in the 
syxt to the Galat. Therfore whyle 

Chaunce.

we haue tyme &c. The Rethorici­
anes put chaunce vnder tyme, be­
cause the ende of a thynge pertey­
neth to the time that foloweth: but 
of thys wyll we speke in the place 
called Euent. Facultie is a power 
to do the thynge that is taken in 
hand: and in coniectures two thin­
ges speciallye be considered: whe­
ther he could or wold. Wyll is ga­
thered of hope to performe it, and 
is made more probable when the na­
ture of the mynde is ioyned to it: 
as it is not like he wyl abide in his 




glorye, because he is enuious and 
ambicious. Also when we counsell 
one to leaue of vayne mournynge, 
when it is not in his power to get 
agayne that is gone.



Instrument.

Instrument semeth to be a part 
of facultie: for instrumentes some­
tyme are cause of oure hablenes to 
do a thinge: and it is a more mische­
uous deede to kyl with venome then 
with swearde. And to instrument 
some is the manour of doyng, that 
almoste it is all one. But more pro­
perlye perteyne to the manour or 
fashion, those thynges that be ey­
ther excused, or made greater by 
wyl: As lesse faute is it to fall into 
a vice by ignorance or frailtie, then 
of a purpose and full deliberacion. 
The vse of circumstances profiteth to 
amplifie, to extenuate, to euidence, 
to confirmacion, and probabilitie. 
And hytherto be referred also the 
common places that indifferentlye 
apperteyne to all kyndes and par­
tes of causes, of the whyche Ro­
dulphe entreateth, and Aristotle 
in his Topyckes. But before we 
speake of them, it is to be noted, 




that thys woorde place, is taken 
foure maner of wayes. They are 
called common places, because thei 
be entreated of, of bothe partes, al­
thoughe not in all one cause: as he 
that is sore spoken agaynste by wit­
nesses, swadeth that we shulde not 
geue credite to witnesses. Contra­
rye, he that is holpen by them spea­
keth in defence of wytnesses, and 
so of other that we spake of before, 
when we entreated of vnartificial 
argumentes. Lyke to thys sorte be 
sentences, whyche wee exaggerate 
as it were wythoute the cause, but 
so that they serue to the cause whi­
che wee haue in hande: as bee the 
amplificacions of vertues, and the 
exaggeracions of vices. As when 
wee accuse anye manne that by e­
uyll companions he was broughte 
to do also the mischeuouse deede, 
A common place shall bee, wyth 
wordes to exaggerate howe much 
it profiteth to keepe goodnesse, to 
bee in companye wyth good men, 
and contrarye howe greate mys­
chyefe the companye of euyll men 
dothe cause. 




In the third sence places be called 
seates of argumentes, whyche the 
Rethoricianes do applie to eche 
kyndes of causes: As in the kynde 
suasorie, honest, profitable, pleasaunt 
easye, necessarie .&c. In demonstra­
tiue kynde, kynred, contrey, goodes 
of the bodye and of the mynde. In 
the Iudiciall kynde, inespecial de­
niall, those that we spake of euen 
nowe. The fourth places be gene­
ral, whych declare what belongeth 
to euerye thynge, and howe oute of 
eche of them there be taken argu­
mentes, partly necessary, and part­
lye probable. These be commen to 
the Oratours with the Logicians, 
albeit Aristotle hathe seperatelye 
written of them in hys Topickes, 
and in his Rethorickes hathe not 
touched them, and they profite much 
both to iudgement, and to endigh­
tynge, but the varietie of authors 
hath made the handlynge of them 
sumwhat darke, because amonge 
them selues they can not wel agre, 
neyther of the names, neyther of 
the number, neyther of the order. 




Examples.

An example is a rehearsall of a 




thynge that is done, and an apply­
nge of it vnto our cause, eyther for 
similitude or dissimilitude, profi­
table to perswade, garnyshe, and 
delyght. Examples, some be taken 
out of hystories, some of tales, some 
of fayned argumentes, in comedies, 
and bothe sortes be dilated by pa­
rable and comparicion. Compara­
cion sheweth it equall, lesse, or byg­
ger. Parable is a feete similitude, 
whych sheweth the example that is 
brought, ether like, vnlyke or contra­
rye. Lyke as Camilius restored the 
common wealth of the Romaines 
that was oppressed by the French­
men, and when it was brought in­
to extreme losse, by theyr valiaunt­
nesse expelled the Barbariens: So 
Valla, whan thorowe the ignorance 
of the Barbarians, learnyng was de­
stroyed, restored it agayn, as it wer 
from death into hys former bright­
nes. Vnlike. As not lyke thanke is 
done to Laurence and Camilius, be­
cause that the one moued by vertue 
wyth the ieopardie of hys lyfe de­
liuered his contrey from the vngra­
cious, that other styrred vp by de­




syre of fame, or rather wyth an e­
uyll luste to checke manye, not resto­
red agayn the latten tong oppressed, 
but brought it as it were into cer­
ten rules. Contrary, Brutus kylled 
hys chyldren goyng about treason, 
Manlius punished by death the va­
liauntnes of hys sonne. Compara­
cion sheweth the thing that is brought, 
eyther equall, lesse, or bigger: Lesse, 
as our elders haue warred often­
tymes, because theyr marchauntes 
and mariners wer euyl entreated. 
What mynd ought you to be in, so 
many thousande citizens of Rome 
slaine at one message, and one time? 
Equall, as in the same Cicero. 
For it happed unto me to stand for 
an offyce wyth two gentlemenne, 
that one very naughte, that other 
very gentle, yet ouercame I Cati­
line by dignitie, and Galba by fa­
uoure. Bygger: As for Milo, they 
saye he shulde not lyue that confes­
seth he hathe kylled a man, when 
M. Horacius was quitte, whyche 
kylled hys owne syster. 




Parable.

Parable, which some call simili­
tude, some comparacion, is a compa­ 




ryng of a thyng that hath no life, or no 
bodye to our cause and purpose, for 
some thyng that is lyke or vnlyke. 
And as example is taken of the dede 
of a man, and the person of an hy­
storye, or that is fabulous and fay­
ned, so is comparison taken of thin­
ges that be done, or that be ioyned 
to them by nature, or by chaunce. 
As Attilius retournyng agayne to 
hys enemies is an example of ke­
pynge faythe and promise: But a 
shyp in the whych the sayles be hoy­
sed vp, or taken down after the blow­
yng of the winde, is a parable whi­
che teacheth a wyse man to geue 
place to tyme, and applye hymselfe 
to the world that is presente. And 
lyke fashion is of dilatyng a para­
ble, as we haue shewed in example. 
For sometime it is noted in a word 
as: Doest thou not vnderstand that 
the sayles muste be turned? Some­
tyme it is more largelye declared, 
as in the oracion for Murena. And 
if vnto menne that sayle out of the 
hauen. &c. Analogia. 



Icon , called of the latines Imago, 
an Image in Englyshe, is muche 




lyke to a similitude, and if you de­
clare it is a similitude: as if you 
saye: As an Asse wyll not be driuen 
from her meat, no not with a club, 
vntyl she be full: no more wil a war­
riour reste from murther vntyll he 
hath fylled his mynd with it. This 
is a similitude: but if you saye that 
a man flewe vpon his enemies like 
a dragon, or lyke a lyon, it is an I­
mage. Howbeit an Image serueth 
rather to euidence or grauitie, or io­
cunditie, then to a profe. There is 
also a general comparacion, speci­
allye in the kynde demonstratiue, 
person wyth person, and one thing 
with an other, for praise or dispraise



Indicacio.

Indicacio, or authoritie, is the com­
paring of an other mans saying or 
sentence vnto our cause: of the whi­
che ther be seuen principal kyndes. 
The fyrst a comon morall sentence, 
as a common principle perteyning 
to maners: as continuall laboure 
ouercommeth all thynges, and as 
be the sentences of Salomon and 
Cato: and all morall philosophy is 
ful of suche sentences. The seconde 
are common rules, whych be called 




dignities in euery science. The .iii. 
a prouerb. The fourth called Chria, 
which is a very short exposicion of 
any dede or worde wyth the name 
of the author recited. The fyfte an 
Enthimeme, whyche is a 
sentence of 
contraries: as if it be a great praise 
to please good men, surely to please 
euyl men it is a greate shame. The 
syxte called AEnos, that is a saying 
or a sentence, taken out of a tale, as 
be the interpretacions of fables, 
and theyr allegories. The seuen is 
any answere taken out of the mouth 
of God, or taken out of the commaun­
dement of God.

"Chria" antedates the earliest OED citation (1612), as does "enthymeme" (1588).





Exergasia.

Expolicion  is, when we tarye in 
one thynge, speakynge the same in 
diuerse wordes and fashions, as 
though it were not one matter but 
diuerse. A goodlye example of the 
moste largest expolicion is rehear­
sed in Erasmus, whych, because it 
is very profitable, I wyll wholye 
rehearse it. A wyse man for the com­
mon wealthe sake shall eschue no pe­
ryll: euen for thys cause that it hap­
peneth often, that wher he wold not 




dye for the common wealth, he pe­
rysheth yet of necessitie wyth the 
common wealth. And because all the 
commodities we haue be taken of 
our contrey, ther ought no incommo­
ditie to be counted paynfull, taken 
for our contrey. They therfore that 
flye that peryll which must be taken 
for the common wealth, do folyshely: 
for neither can they auoyde it, and 
they be found vngrate to the citie. 
But they that by their owne peril 
put away the perils of their contrei, 
they are to be counted wyse, seyng 
that bothe they geue to the common 
wealth that honour that they shulde 
geue, and had rather dye for many, 
then with many. For it is much against 
reason that receiuing thy naturall 
lyfe by thy contrey, to deliuer it a­
gayne to nature when she compel­
leth the, and not to geue it to thy con­
trey when she desyreth the. And 
where thou mayst wyth hye valiaunt­
nes & honour die for thy contrei, to 
haue rather lyke a cowarde to liue 
in shame. And for thy fryndes and 
parentes, and other acquayntance 
to put thy selfe in peryll: for the co­




mon wealth in the whyche both it 
& that most reuerende name of the 
contrey is conteyned, not to be wil­
lynge to come in ieopardye. Wher­
fore as he is to be dyspised whyche 
being vpon the sea had rather haue 
hym selfe safe, then the ship: so is he 
to be rebuked, whych in ieopardye 
of the commen wealthe, prouideth 
more for his own then for the common 
wealthe. When the shyppe hathe 
ben broken, many haue ben saued: 
But after the shypwrake of the con­
trey no man can escape. Whyche 
thynge me thynketh Decius dyd 
wel perceiue, whych reported who­
ly to haue bestowed hym selfe, and 
for the sauegard of his men of war 
to haue run amonge the myddest 
of hys enemyes. Wherfore he loste 
not hys lyfe, but let it go: for he re­
demed for a thynge of verye small 
pryce, a ryght dere thyng. He gaue 
his life, but he receiued his contrei. 
He loste his life, but he inioyed glo­
rye, whyche written to his greate 
prayse, shyneth euerye daye more 
and more. Wherefore if we haue 
proued both by reason & by example, 




that we be bounde to put oure selfe 
in peryll for the common wealthe, 
they are to be counted wyse men, 
whych for the sauegarde of the con­
trey auoyde no peryll. It wolde be 
meete to exercyse chyldren in suche 
themes, wherby shal be gotten bothe 
wysedome and eloquence. And here 
me thynketh I maye ryghte well 
ende these Rethoricall preceptes, 
although I be not ignoraunt that 
much helpeth bothe to persuasions 
and copye, the proper handlyng of 
tales taken oute of the nature of 
beastes, dreames, fayned narraci­ 
ons, sumwhat lyke vnto the truth, 
with allegories much vsed of diuines. 
But because they requyre a longer 
treatie, for this tyme I leaue them 
of, addynge vnto these before writ­
ten rules of oratory, a declamacion 
bothe profitable and verye elo­
quente, wrytten by Erasmus 
vnto the moste noble Duke 
of Cleue, as here appe­
reth after.
