Alphabetically explaining the abstruse 
Words and Phrases that are used in 
Typography. Which also may serve as 
an Index to direct to the most material 
Concerns contained in this Volumn.

Though I give you a Dictionary of so many 
Words and Phrases as are mentioned in these 
Exercises, yet I do not exhibit this as a Di­
ctionary so perfect, that all the obstruce 
Words and Phrases used among Printers, Letter­
cutters and Founders are here exposed; for Words 
and Phrases many times offer themselves either as 
Discourse or Contemplation occurs: Therefore such 
Words and Phrases as have escaped my Considerati­
on, will, I hope, be discovered by some Printer, or 
others, that may have a kindness for Posterity; not 
only in this Trade, but in all Trades and Faculties 
whatsoever: That so a Dictionary may in time be 
compleated, that may render so great a number of 
Words used in England by English-men intelligible; 
which now for want of a proper Repository to store 
them in, seem not only Aliens to our Nation, but 
barbarous to our understandings.





A

Abreviations  are Characters, or else marks on Let­
ters, to signifie either a Word or Syllable. & is the 
Character for And, ye is The abreviated, yt is That
abreviated; and several other such. Straight stroaks 
over any of the Vowels abreviates m or n. They 
have been much used by Printers in Old Times, to 
Shorten or Get in Matter; but now are wholly left 
off as obsolete.I've removed  lexeme="and(d)" lexeme="that(r)" from the closing form tag and placed them in the xpln tag. MP

Accented Letters  are much used in Latin Authors, 
and more in Greek. The Vowels are only accented, 
and are called Grave, thus accented à; Acute, thus 
accented á; Circumflex, thus accented â; and Deere­
cis, thus accented ä.

Accents  are Dashes or Marks over the Vowels.

man only examines that the Folio and beginning word 
of the Second Page, and Signature of the First and

Knock up a Letter.  It sometimes happens with 
old Letter, that a Letter may be worn so low that 
it will not Print well in a Page: The Workman 
then takes that Letter out of the Form, and holds 
the Shank of it upon the side of the Chase, and with 
the Head of the Shooting-stick beats lightly upon 
the Foot of the Shank, till he have battered Mettle 



enough out of the Shank, to raise it higher against 
Paper: If it prove too high against Paper, he Rubs 
the bottom of the Shank upon the side of the Chase 
to rub it down: This Operation seldom happens, 
unless another of the same sort of Letter is wanting, 
and hard to come by: For else the Compositer will 
bow the Letter, and pop it into a Waste Box in his 
Case, where he puts all naughty Letters, that he 
may not be troubled with them another time.

if after Overrunning on the Correcting-stone he has 
not Set his Letter in a Square position again, before 
he Locks up, (for we may suppose when the Pages 
are Open'd the Letter stands Loose, and more or

Turn for a Letter.  It often happens when Matter 
Runs upon Sorts, especially in Capitals, or some 
other Sorts seldom used, that the Compositer wants 
that Sort the Matter Runs on; wherefore he is loath 
to Destribute Letter for that Sort; or perhaps his Case 
is otherwise Full. Wherefore instead of that Letter 
or Sort, he Turns a Letter of the same Thickness, 
with the Foot of the Shank upwards, and the Face 
downwards; which Turned Letter being easie to 
be seen, he afterwards when he can accommodate 
himself with the right Sort, takes out, and puts 
the right Letter in its room. It is also a word used 
jocosely in the Chappel, when any of the Workmen 
complain of want of Money, or any thing else, he 
shall by another Workman be answered, Turn for it,
