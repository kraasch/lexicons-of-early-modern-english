A table expoundinge certey­
ne wordes 




Abrech / tender father / or as some will / bo­
we the knee. 

Arcke / a shippe made flatte as it were a chest 
or a cofer. 



Bisse: fyne whyte / whether it be silke or linen. 

Blesse: godes blessinges are his giftes / as in 
the firste chaptre he blessed them / sayng: growe & 
multiplye & haue dominion &c. And in the .ix. 
chaptre he blessed Noe and his sonnes / & gaue them 
dominion over all beestes & authoryte to eate them. 
And god blessed Abraham with catell and other 
ryches. And Iacob desyred Esau to receaue the 
blessinge which he brought him /that is the prea­
sent & gifte. God blessed the .vii. daye / that is / ga­
ue it a prehemynence that men shuld rest therein 
from bodely laboure & lerne to know the will of 
god & his lawes & how to worke their workes 
godly all the weke after. God also blesseth all 
nations in Abrahams seed / that is / he turneth 
his loue & fauoure vnto them and geueth them his 
spirite and knowledge of the true waye / and lust 
and power to walke therin / and all for christes
sake Abrahams sonne. 



Cain / so it is writen in Hebrue. Notwithstondin­
ge whether we call him Cain or caim it maketh 
no matter / so we vnderstond the meaninge. 




Euery lande hath his maner / that we call 
Ihonn the welchemen call Evan: the douch 
hance. Soch difference is betwene the Ebrue / gre­
ke and laten: and that maketh them that trans­
late out of the ebrue varye in names from them 
that translate out of laten or greke. 

Curse: Godes curse is the takynge awaye of his 
benefytes. As god cursed the erth and made it 
baren. So now hunger / derth / warre / pestilen­
ce and soch like are yet ryght curses and sig­
nes of the wrath of God vnto the vnbeleuers: 
but vnto them that knowe Christ / they are ve­
ry blessinges and that wholsome crosse & true 
purgatorye of oure flesh / thorow which all must 
go that will lyue godly and be saued: as thou re­
adest Matt. v. Blessed are they that suffre per­
secution for rightewesnes sake. &c. And hebre­
wes .xi. The lorde chastyseth whom he loueth 
and scorgeth all the children that he receaueth. 



Eden: pleasure. 



Firmament: The skyes

Fayth is the beleuinge of goddes promesses & 
a sure trust in the goodnesse and truth of god. 
Which faith iustifyeth Abraham gen. xv. and 
was the mother of all his good workes which 
he afterward did. For faith is the goodnesse of 
all workes in the sight of God. Good workes 




are thinges of godes commaundement / wrought 
in faith. And so sow a showe at the commaun­
dement of god to do thy neyghboure seruice
withall / with faith to be saued by Christ (as god 
promyseth vs.) is moch better then to bild an ab­
bay of thyne awne imagination / trustinge to be 
saued by the fayned workes of hypocrites. Ia­
cob robbed Laban his vncle: Moses robbed 
the Egiptians: And Abraham is aboute to slee 
and burne his awne sonne: And all are holye
workes / because they were wrought in fayth 
at goddes commaundement. To stele / robbe and 
murther are no holye workes before worldly 
people: but vnto them that haue their truste in 
god: they are holye when god commaundeth 
them. What god commaundeth not getteth no 
reward with god. Holy workes of mens ima­
gination receaue their rewarde here / as Christ 
testyfyeth Matt. .vi. How be it of fayth & wor­
kes I haue spoken abundantly in mammon. 
Let him that desyreth more seke there. 



Grace: fauoure / As Noe founde grace / that is 
to saye fauoure and loue. 



Ham and Cam all one. 



Iehouah is goddes name / nether is any crea­
ture so called. And it is as moch to saye as one 
that is of him self / and dependeth of nothinge. 
Moreouer as oft as thou seist LORde in gre­




at letters (excepte there be any erroure in the pren­
tinge) it is in hebrewe Iehouah / thou that arte 
or he that is. 



Marshall / In hebreue he is called Sar tabaim / 
as thou woldest saye / lorde of the slaughtermen 
And though that Tabaim be taken for cokes in 
many places / for the cokes did sle the beastes 
them selues in those dayes: yet it may be taken for 
them that put men to execution also. And that 
me thought it should here best signifye in as 
moch as he had the ouersight of the kinges per­
son and the kinges presoners were they neuer 
so great men were vnder his custodye. And ther­
fore I call him cheffe marshall an officer as 
is the lefetenaunte of the toure / or master of the 
marshalsye. 



Slyme was their morter .xi. Chapter / And sly­
me pittes .xiiij. chapter: that slyme was a fatte­
nesse that osed out of the erth lyke vnto tarre / 
And thou mayst call it cement / if thou wilt. 

Siloh after some is as moch to saye as sent / & 
after some / happie / and after some it signifieth 
Mesias / that is to saye annoynted / and that we 
call Christe after the greke worde. And it is a 
prophesie of Christ: For after that all the other tri­
bes were in captiuite & their kyngdom destroy­
ed / yet the tribe of Iuda had a ruler of the sa­
me bloud / euen vnto the comynge of Christ. 




And aboute the cominge of Christ the Romayns 
conquered them / and the Emperoure gaue the 
kyngdom of tribe Iuda vnto Herode which 
was a straunger / euen an Edomite of the gene­
racyon of Esau. 



Testament here / is an appoyntement betwe­
ne god and man / and goddes promyses. And sa­
crament is a signe representinge soch an appoyn­
tement and promeses: as the raynebowe re­
presenteth the promyse made to Noe / that god 
will no more drowne the worlde. And circum­
cision representeth the promyses of god to A­
braham on the one syde / and that Abraham and 
his seed shuld circumcyse and cut off the lustes 
of their fleshe / on the other syde / to walke in the 
wayes of the lorde: As baptyme which is co­
me in the roume therof / now signifieth on the 
one syde / how that all that repent and beleue a­
re washed in Christes bloud: And on the other
syde / how that the same must quench and drou­
ne the lustes of the flesh / to folow the steppes 
of Christ.

There were tyrantes in the erth in those dayes / 
for the sonnes of god saw the doughters of 
men. &c. The sonnes of god were the prophetes 
childerne / which (though they succeded there fa­
thers) fell yet from the right waye / and thorow 
falsehod of hypocrysye subdued the world vn­
der them / and became tyrantes / As the succes­




sours of the apostles haue played with vs. 



Vapor. a dewy miste / as the smoke of a sethyn­
ge pott. 



To walke with god is to lyue godly and to 
walke in his commaundementes.

Enos walked with god and was no moare se­
ne: that is / he lyued godly and dyed / God toke 
him a waye: that is / god hyd his bodye / as he 
did Moses and Aarons: lest haplye they shuld 
haue made an Idoll of him / for he was a gre­
at preacher and an holye man. 



Zaphnath paenea / wordes of Egipte are they 
(as I suppose) and as moch to saye: as a man 
to whom secrete thinges be opened / or an expo­
under of secrete thinges as some enterprete it.

That Ioseph brought the egiptians in to soch 
subiection wold seme vnto some a very cruell 
deade: how be it it was a very equal waye. For 
they payde but the fifte part of that that grewe 
on the grounde. And therwith were they qwytt 
of all duetyes / both of rent / custome / tribute & 
toll. And the kinge therwith founde them lor­
des and all ministres and defended them. We 
now paye half so moch vnto the prestes only / 
besyde their other craftye exactions. Then paye 
we rent yerely / though there grow neuer so lit­
le on the grounde / 'And yet / when the kinge cal­




leth paye we neuer the lesse. So that if we lo­
ke indifferently / their condition was easyar then 
oures / and but euen / a very indifferent waye / both 
for the comen people and the kynge also.

Se therfore that thou loke not on the ensam­
ples of the scripture with wordly eyes: lest thou 
preferre Cain before Abel / Ismael before Isa­
ac / Esau before Iacob / Ruben before Iu­
da / Sarah before Pharez / Manas­
es before Ephraim. And e­
uen the worst before the
best / as the maner
of the worl­
de is. 








ALBE, a longe garment of white lynen. 

Arcke / a cofer or cheste as our shrynes 
saue it was flatte, and the sample of oure shrynes 
was taken thereof. 



Boothe, an housse made of bowes. 

Brestlappe or brestflappe, is soche a flappe as 
thou seist in the brest of a cope. 



Consecrate / to apoynte a thinge to holy vses. 



Dedicate, purifie or sanctifie. 






Ephod, is a garment somwhat like an amyce, 
saue the armes came thorow and it was gird to. 



Geeras, in weyght as it were an englysh halff­
penye or somwhat more. 



Heveoffringe, because they were houen vp be­
fore the Lorde.

kynred or a multitude of people to springe 
out of them: as we saye the house of Dauid for 
the kinred of Dauid.

uotion, and not for concience of sinne and trespace.

and to bringe in grace or fauoure. 



Sanctefie, to clense and purifie, to apointe a thin­
ge vnto holie vses and to separate from vnclene 
and vnholye vses. 

Sanctuarie, a place halowed 
and dedicate vnto god. 



Tabernacle, an hou­
se made tentwise, or as a pauelion.

wauen in the preastes handes to diuers quarters.

Worshuppe: by worshuppinge whether it be 
in the old testament or the newe, vnderstond the 
bowenge of a mans self vppon the grounde: 
As wee oftymes as we knele in oure prayers 
bowe oure selues and lye on oure armes and han­
des with oure face to the grounde.

goate both. 12. Chap.

This word-entry appears in the 1573 edition of Tyndale's Workes, sig. d2r.	



The Lambe was called passeouer / 
that the very name it selfe, should put 
them in remembraunce, what it signi­
fied, for the signes that God ordained, 
either signified the benefites done, or 
promisses to come, and were not done, 
as the signes of our domme God the 
Pope.
