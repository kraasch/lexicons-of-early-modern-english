¶ Here begynneth a newe tracte or trea­
tyse moost profytable for all husbande men:
and very frutefull for all other
persons to rede.

¶ To knowe the names of all
partes of the plough. 
MEn that be no husbandes maye fortune to rede 
this boke that knoweth nat whiche is the plough
beam / the sharebeam / the plough sheth / the plough






tayle / the stylt / the rest / the sheldbrede / the fenbrede / 
the rough staues. The plough eare / the plough fote 
or coke the share / the culture or plough mall. Pera­
uenture I gyue them these names here as is vsed in 
my countre / and yet in other countreis they haue o­
ther names. Wherfore ye shall knowe the plogh be­
ame / is the longe tre aboue: the which is a lytell bende
the sharebeam is the tre vnderneth / whervpon the 
share is set / the plough sheth is a thyn pease of drie 
wode made of oke that is set fast in a mortes in the plo­
ugh beam / & also into the sharbeam / the which is the 
key & the chefe bande of all the plough. The plough 
tayle is that the husbande holdeth in his hand & the 
hynder end of the ploughbeam is put in a long slyt / 
made in the same tayle & nat set fast / but it may ryse 
vp and go downe and is pynned behynde / and the 
same plough tayle is set fast in a mortes in the hyn­
der end of the sharbeam. The plough stylt is on the 
right syde of the plough / whervpon the rest is a ly­
tell pease of wode pynned fast vpon the nether ende 
and to the sharbeam in the forther ende / the shelbrede 
is a brode pease of wode fast pynned to the sheth in 
the forther ende / and to the vtter syde of the stylte in 
the hynder ende / the fenbrede is a thynne borde pyn­
ned or nayled moost commonly to the sheth in the for­
ther ende / and to the plogh tayle in the hynder ende. 
And the sayd shelbrede wolde come ouer the sayd sheth
and fenbrede an inch / and to come past the myddes 
of the share made with a sharpe edge / to receyue and 
tourne the yerth whan the culture hath cut it. There 






be two ronge staues in euery plough in the hynder 
ende set a slope bytwene the plough tayle & the stylt 
to holde out and kepe the plough a brode in the hyn­
der ende / and the one lengar than the other. The 
plough fote is a lytell pese of wode with a croked ende 
set before in a mortes in the plough beam / sette fast 
with wedges / to driue vp and downe & it is a stay /
to order of what depnesse the plough shall go. The 
plogh eare is made of thre peces of yron nayled fast 
to the right syde of the plough beam. And pore men 
haue a croked pese of wode pynned fast to the plough
beme. The share is a pese of yron sharpe before and
brode behynde a fote long made with a socket to be 
set on the farther ende of the sharbeame / the culture 
is a bende pese of yron sette in a mortes in the myd­
des of the plough beame / fastened with wedges on 
euery syde: & the backe therof is half an inch thycke 
and thre inches brode / and made kene before to cut
the yerth clene / and it must be well steeled: and that 
shall cause the easyer draught / and the yrons to last 
moche lengar. The plough mall is a pese of harde 
wode with a pynne putte through set in the plough 
beame in a naugers bore.

[plough] "staues" antedates the earliest OED citation (1538). 



¶ The temperyng of plowes. 
NOw the plowes be made of dyuers maners /
it is necessary for a husband to knowe howe
these plowes shulde be tempred to plowe & turne clene
and to make no rest balkes. A rest balke is where the 
plough byteth at the poynt of the culture and share
and cutteth nat the grounde clene to the forowe that 






was plowed last before / but leueth a lytell rigge stan­
dyng bytwene / the which doth brede thistels and o­
ther wedes. All these maner of plowes shuld haue al 
lyke one maner of temperyng in the yrons: howbeit a 
man may tempar for one thyng in .ii. or thre places / as 
for depnes. The fote is in the settyng of the culture 
of a depnes is a nother / & the third is at the plough 
tayle: where be two wedges that be called slote wed­
ges. the one is in the slote aboue the beam / another 
in the sayd slote vnder the plough beam: and other 
whyle he wyl set both aboue or both vnderneth / but 
alway let hym take gode hede & kepe one general rule
that the hynder end of the sharbem alway touch the 
erth / that it may kyll a worme / or els it goth nat tru­
ly. The temperyng to go brode & narowe is in the set­
tyng of the culture / and with the driueng of his syde 
wedges / forewedg / and hele wedg / which wolde be 
made of drie wode: & also the settyng on of his share
helpeth well / and is a connyng poynt of husbandrie &
mendeth & pereth moch plowyng / but it is so narow
a poynt to knowe / that it is harde to make a man to 
vnderstande it by writyng: without he were at the 
operacion therof to tech men the practyue / for it must
lene moch into the forowe / & the poynt may nat stande 
to moch vp nor downe / nor to moche into the lande 
nor into the forowe. Howbeit the settyng of the cul­
ture helpeth moche. Some plowes haue a bende of 
yron tryanglewyse / set there as the plough eare shuld 
be that hath thre nyckes on the farther  syde: and yf 
he woll haue his plough to go a narowe forowe than 






he setteth his fote team in the nicke next to the plogh 
beam / and if he woll go a meyn brede he setteth it in 
the myddle nicke / and if he wold go a brode forowe 
he setteth it in the vttermast nycke. The which is a 
good way to kepe the brede and sone tempered / but 
it serueth natte the depnesse. And some men haue in 
stede of the plogh fote a pese of yron set vp right / they 
call a coke made with two or thre nickes / & that ser­
ueth for depnesse. The plowes that go with whelys 
haue a streit beam & may be tempred in the yron as 
the other be for the brede / but their moost speciall tem­
per is at the bolster where as the plough beam lyeth 
and that serueth both for depnes and for brede. And 
they be gode on euen grounde that lyeth light / but me 
semeth / they be fare more costly / than the other plowes
And though these plowes be well tempered for one 
maner of grounde / that temper woll nat serue in an 
other maner of ground / but it must rest in the discre­
cyon of the husbande to knowe whan it goeth well.

"slote wedge" appears in OED, "slot," n.2, 2a (this quotation).



¶ The necessary thynges that longeth
to a plough / cart / or wayne. 
BVt or he begynne to plowe / he must haue his 
plough and his plough yron / his oxen or hor­
ses / and the geyr that longeth to them. That is to say:  
yokes / landes / stylkynges / wrethyng teames. And or 
he shall lode his corne / he must haue a wayne a cop/
yoke / a payre of sleues / a wayne rope / & a pycforke. 
This wayne is made of dyuers peces that woll haue 
great reparacion: that is to say they wheles / & those 
be made of nathes spokes fellies & doules / and they 






must be well fettred with wode or yron. And if they 
be yron bounden they are moche the better / & though 
they be the derer at the first / yet at length they be bet­
ter chepe: for a peyre of whelys yron bounde woll 
weare seuyn or eyght peyre of other whelys / & they 
go rounde and light after oxen or horses to drawe. 
Howbeit on mares ground and soft ground the o­
ther whelys be better: bycause they be broder on the 
soule / and woll nat go so depe. They must haue an 
axyltre clout with eight wayne cloutes of yron / two
lynpines of yron in the axyltre endes / two axyll pyn­
nes of yron / or els of tough harde wode. The body 
of the wayn of oke / the staues / the nethar rathes / the 
ouer rathes / the crosse somer / the keys and pycsta­
ues. And if he go with a horse plough / than must he 
haue his horses / mares / or bothe / his hombers or col­
lers / holmes whyted / treyses / swyngletrees / & toge­
withes. Also a cart made of asshe bycause it is light 
and lyke stoffe to it / as it is to a wayne / and also a 
cart sadell / bacbandes / belly bandes / and a cart lad­
der behynde, whan he shall cary outher corne or kyd­
des or suche other. And in many countreis their way­
nes haue cart ladders bothe behynde and before: al ­
so an husbande must haue an axe / a hachet / a hed­
gyngbyll / a pyn nawger / a rest nawger. And how­
beit that I gyue them these names as is moost common­
ly vsed in my contrey: I knowe they haue other na­
mes in other countreis / but herby a man may perceyue 
many thynges longeth to husbandrie / to their great 
costes and charges: for the mayntenance and vphol­






dyng of the same. And many mo thynges are belon­
gyng to husbandes than these: as ye shall well par­
ceyue or I haue made an ende of this treatyse. 

"cop" appears to antedate the earliest citation in the OED 
(OED "cop," n. 4, "movable frame attached to the front of a wagon or farm cart").








¶ To sowe Barley. 






It is to be 
knowen that there be thre maner of barleis / that is to 
say sprot barley / longe eyre / and bere barley that some 
men call bygge. Sprot barley hath a flat eyre moost 
commenly thre quartters of an inch brode / and thre 
inches longe / and the cornes be very great & white / 
and it is the best barley. Longe eyre hath a flat eyre
halfe an inch brode and .iiii. inches & more of length
but the corne is nat so great nor so white and sander
it wyll growe to the otes. Beyr barley or bigge wold 
be sowen vpon lyght & dry grounde and hath an eyre 
thre inches of length or more set foure square lyke 
pecke whete smale cornes & lytell floure / and that is 
the worst barley / and .iiii. london busshels are suffi­
cient for an acre. And in some countreis they do nat 
sowe theyr barley tyll May / & that is moost commen­
ly vpon grauell or sandy grounde. But that barley 
generally is neuer so good as that / that is sowen in 
March. For yf it be very dry wether after it be sow­
en / that corne that lyeth aboue lieth dry and hath no 
moysture. And that / that lyeth vnderneth cometh 
vp / and whan rayne cometh than spriteth that / that 






lyeth aboue and often tymes it is grene whan the 
other is ripe / and whan it is thresshen there is mo­
che lyght corne. &c. 

"bere barley" antedates the earliest OED citation (1901) but see also OED, 
"barley malt" ("barley," n. [1488]).



¶ To sowe otes. 
And it 
is to be knowen that there be .iii. maner of otes / that 
is to say red othes / blake otes / and roughe otes. Red 
otes are the best otes / and whanne they be thresshed
they be yelowe in the busshell / & very good to make 
otemeyle of. Blake otes are as great as they be but 
they haue nat so moch flowre in them / for they haue 
a thycker huske / & also they be nat so good to make 
otemeyle. The rough otes be the worst otes and it 
quyteth nat the cost to sowe them. They be very light
and haue longe tayles wherby they wyll hang eche 
one to other. All these maner of otes wear the grounde 
very sore & maketh it to be quycche.

For "rough oats," see OED, "skeg," n. 1.









¶ To knowe dyuers maners of wedes. 
IN the later end of May & the begynninge of 
Iune is tyme to wede the corne. There be dy­
uers maner of wedes / as thistyls / kedlokes / dockes /
cocle drake / darnold / goldes / hadoddes / dogfenell / 
mathes / terre / and dyuers other small wedes. But 
these be they that greue moost. The thistyll is an yll 
wede rough & sharpe to handell / and freteth away 
the cornes nigh it / and causeth the sherers nat to shere 
clene. Kedlokes hath a lefe lyke rapes & bereth a ye­
lowe floure & is an yll wede & groweth in all maner 
corne & hath small coddes & groweth lyke mustarde 
sede. Dockes haue a brode lefe & dyuers hygh spyres 
& very smale sede in the toppe. Cockole hath a longe 
smale lefe and wyll bere .v. or .vi. floures purple co­
loure as brode as a grote & the sede is rounde & black
and may well be suffred in bred corne / but nat in sede
for there in is moch floure. Drake is like vnto rye tyl 
it begyn to sede / and it hath many sedes lyke fenell 
sedes and hangeth downwarde / and it may well 
be suffred in bredde / for there is moch floure in the 
sede / and it is an oppinyon that it cometh of rye. &c. 
Dernolde groweth vp streyght lyke an hye grasse / 
and hath longe sedes on eyther syde the stert & there 
is moch floure in that sede & groweth moch among 
barley / and it is sayd that it cometh of smale barley 
Goldes hath a short iagged lefe and groweth halfe 
a yarde hygh and hath a yelowe floure as brode as 
a grote / and is an yll wede and groweth commonly in 






barley and pees. Hawdod hath a blewe flower and 
a fewe lytell leues and hath fyue or sixe braunches
flowred in the toppe / and groweth commenly in rye 
vpon lene grounde and doth lytell hurt. Dogfenell 
and mathes is both one / & in the commyng vp is lyke 
fenell and bereth many white floures with a yelow 
sede / and it is the worst wede that is / except terre / & 
it cometh moost commonly whan great weyt cometh 
shortly after the corne be sowen. Terre is the worst 
wede & it neuer doth apere tyll the moneth of Iune / 
and specially whan ther is great weyt in that mone 
or a lytell before / and groweth moost in rye / and it 
groweth like fitches / but it is moch smaler / & it wyl 
growe as hye as the corne & with the weyght therof
it pulleth the corne flatte to the erthe and freteth the 
eyres away / wherfore I haue sene husbandes mowe 
downe the corne & it togyder / and also with sharpe 
hokes to repe it as they doo pees & make it dry / and 
than it wyll be good fodder / there be other wedes nat 
spoken of / as deed netels dodder / and suche other do
moch harme.

"cockledrake" and "drake" (in the sense of a plant) not found in OED. Possibly by "drake" 
is meant a species of "dragons," that is, dragonwort.








¶ To sowe whete and rye. 






And ye 
shal vnderstande that there be dyuers maners of whe­
tes. Flaxen whete hath a yelowe eyre & bare without 
anis / and is the brightest whete in the busshell and 
wyll make the whitest bredde / and it wyll were the 
grounde sore & is small strawe and wyll growe ve­
ry thicke / & is but small corne. Polerde whete hath 
no anis thicke set in the eyre & wyll soone fall out &
is gretter corne and wyll make white bredde. White 
whete is lyke polard whete in the busshell but it hath 
anis / and the eyre is foure square & wyll make white 
bredde. And in Essexe they call flaxen whete white 
whete. Red whete hath a flat eyre an inch brode full 
of anis & is the gretest corne and the brodest blades 
and the gretest strawe / & wyll make white bredde &
is the ruddest of coloure in the busshell. Englysshe 
whete hath a dunne yere fywe anis or none / & is the 






worst whete saue peeke whete. Peeke whete hath a 
red eyre full of anis thynne set & of tymes it is flyn­
tered. that is to say small corne wryngeled and dry­
ed & wyll nat make white bredde / but it wyll growe 
vpon colde grounde. 






¶ The pockes / and remedy therfore. 
THe pockes apere vpon the skynne & are lyke 
reed pu+_mples as brod as a farthing and there
wyll dye but fewe. And the remedy therfore is to han­
dell all thy shepe and to loke on euery part of theyr 
bodyes / and as many as ye fynde taken therwith.
Put them in fresshe newe grasse and kepe them fro 
their felowes / and to loke his floke oft & draw them 
as they nede / and if it be in somer tyme wasshe them 
Howbeit some shepherdes haue other medicyns. 






¶ The wode yuell and remedy therfore. 
THere is a sykenesse among shepe and is called the 
wode yuell / and that cometh in the spring of 
the yere and taketh them moost commonly in the leg­
ges or in the necke and maketh them to halte and to 
holde their necke a wry / & the moost part that haue 
that sykenesse wyll dye shortly in a day or two / the 
best remedy is to wasshe theym a lytell & to chaunge 
their grounde / and to bring them to lowe ground & 
freshe grasse. And that sykenesse is moost commenly 
on hylly grounde / ley grounde / & feerny grounde. 
And some men vse to let them blode vnder the eye in 
a vayne for the same cause.






¶ What thynges roteth shepe. 
IT is necessary that a shepherde shuld knowe 
what thyng rote shepe: that he myght kepe them 
the better. There is a grasse called sperewort / & hath 
a long narow lefe lyke a spere heed / & it wyll growe 
a fote hygh and bereth a yelowe floure / as brode as a 






penny: and it groweth alway in lowe places / where 
the water is vsed to stande in wynter. Another gras
is called penny grasse: and groweth lowe by the erth
in a marsshe grounde / and hath a leafe as brode as a 
penny of two pens / and neuer bereth floure. All ma­
ner of grasse that the lande flode ronneth ouer is yll 
for shepe: bycause of the sand and fylth that sticketh 
vpon it. All marres grounde and marsshe grounde 
is yll for shepe / the grasse that groweth vpon falow­
es is nat good for shepe / for there is moch of it wede /
and oft tymes it cometh vp by the rote and that brin­
geth yerth with it / and they eate both. &c. Myldewe 
grasse is nat gode for shepe / and that shall ye knowe 
two wayes: one is by the leues on the trees in a mor­
nyng / & specially of okes. Take the leaues & put thy 
tong to them / and thou shalte fele lyke honny vpon 
theym: and also there wyll be many kelles vpon the 
gras / and that causeth the myldewe. Wherfore they 
may nat well be lette out of the folde / tyll the sonne 
haue domynacion to drie them away: also hunger / 
rote is the worst rote that can be: for there is nother 
good flesshe nor good skynne / and that maketh for 
lacke of meate. And so for hunger they eate suche as 
they canne fynde: and so will nat pasture shepe / for 
they syldome rote but with myldewes: & than wyll 
they haue moche talowe & flesshe / and a good skyn. 
also whyte sneles be yll for shepe in pastures and in 
falowes. There is a nother rote is called pelt rote: 
and that cometh of great weate / specially in wood 
countreis where they can nat drie.






¶ Dyuers sickenesses of cattell: and re­
medyes therfore / amd first
of murren. 
ANd if it fortune to fall murren amon­
ge thy beestes: as god forbede / there 
be men ynowe can helpe them. And it 
cometh of a ranckenesse of blode: and 
appereth moost commonly first in his 
heed / for his heed woll swell and his eyen waxe gret 
and ron of water / and froth at the mouth / and than 
he is past remedy and woll dye shortely: for he woll 
neuer eate after he be syke. Than flee hym & make a 
depe pyt fast there as he dyeth and cast hym in: and 
couer hym with yerth / that no dogges may come to 
the caryen. For as many beestes as feleth the smell of 
that caryen ar likely to be infect: and take the skynne
and haue it to the tanners to sell / but bringe it natte 
home for peryll that may fall. And it is commonly 
vsed and cometh of a great charyte: to take the bare 
heed of the same beest and put it vpon a longe pooll 
and set it in a hedge fast bounden to a stake by the hy
way syde / that euery man that rydeth or goeth that 
way may se and knowe by that signe / that there is sic­
kenes of cattell in that towneshyp. And the husban­
des holde an oppynion that it shall the rather cease. 
And whan the beest is fleen: there as the murren doth 
apere bytwene the flesshe and the skyn / it woll ryse 
vp like a ielly and froth an ynch depe and more / and 
this is the remedy for the murren. Take a small cur­






ten corde and bynde it hard about the beestes necke 
and that woll cause the blode to come into the necke
and on eyther syde of the necke there is a vayne that 
a man may fele with his fynger. And thanne take a 
blode yron and sette it streight vpon the vayne / and 
smyte hym blode on bothe sydes: and let hym blede 
the mountenance of a pynt or nigh it / and than take 
away the corde / and it woll staunche bledyng. And 
this serue all thy catell that be in that close or pastur
and there shall no mo be sicke by goddes leaue.

¶ Longsaught / and reme­
dy therfore. 
THere is a nother maner of sickenesse among 
beestes: is called longesaught / and that sicke­
nesse woll endure longe / and ye shall perceyue it by 
his hoystinge / he woll stande moche and eate but a 
littel and waxe very holowe and thyn. And he woll 
hoyste twentie tymes in an houre: and but fewe of 
them do mende. The best remedy is to kepe thy ca­
tell in sondrie places: and as many as were in com­
pany with that beest that first fell sicke to lette them 
a lyttel blode. And there be many men that canne se­
uer them / and that is to cutte the dewelappe before / 
and there is a grasse that is called settergrasse. And
take that grasse and bruse it a lytell in a morter / and 
put therof asmoche as an hennes egge into the sayd 
dewelappe / and se it fall natte out. Thus I haue 
sene vsed / and men haue thought 
it hath done good.






¶ Dewebolue / and the harde 
remedy therfore. 
AN other dysease amonge beestes: is called 
dewebolue / and that cometh whan a hungry 
beest is putte in a good pasture full of ranke grasse.
He woll eate so moche: that his sydes wyll stande 
as hye as his backe bone / and outher whyle the one 
syde more than the other / and but fewe of them woll 
dye: but he may natte be dryuen hastely nor labou­
red beyng so swolen / and the substaunce of it is but 
wynde. And therfore he wolde rest: howbeit I haue 
sene a man take a knyfe and thrust hym thorowe the 
skynne and the flesshe two inches depe or more / sixe
inchesse or more fro the rybbe bone / that the wynde 
may come oute. For the wynde lyeth bytwene the 
flesshe and the great paunche.

¶ Rysen vpon / and the re­
medy therfore. 
ANother dysease is called rysen vpon / and no 
man can tell howe nor wherof it cometh / but 
ye shall perceyue that by swellyng in the heed / and spe­
cially by the eyen / for they woll ron on water & close 
his sight & woll dye shortly within an hour or two if 
he be nat holpen / this is the cause of this dysease: there 
is a blyster rysen vnder the tonge / the which blyster 
must be slytte with a knyfe a crosse. Whan ye haue 
pulled out the tong / rubbe the blyster well with salt






and take an hennes egge / and breke it in the beestes 
mouth shell and all & cast salte to it / and holde vp the 
beestes heed / that all may be swalowed downe into 
the body. But the brekyng of the blyster is the great 
helpe: and driue the beest a lytell about / & this shall 
saue hym by the helpe of Christ Ihesu.

¶ The tourne / and remedy 
therfore. 
THere be beestes that woll tourne about
whan they eate their meate: and woll 
nat fede / and is great ieopardy for fal­
lyng in pyttes / dyches / or waters. And 
it is bycause that there is a bledder in 
the foreheed: bytwene the brayne pan and the bray­
nes / the which must be taken out / or els he shal ne­
uer mende but dye at length. And this is the reme­
dy / and the grettest cure that can be on a beest: take 
that beest and cast hym downe and bynde his foure 
fete togyder: and with thy thombe thrust the beest in 
the forheed / and where thou fyndest the softest place /
there take a knyfe and cutte the skynne thre or foure
