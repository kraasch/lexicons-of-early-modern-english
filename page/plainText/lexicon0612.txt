To the HONOURABLE. 
Sir Cloudsley Shouel, Knight. 
Vice-Admiral of the RED 
SQADRON 
Of the Royal Navy of England. 

Renowned SIR,  

MY chief aim in Publish­
ing this small Piece, is 
for the benefit of Sea­
men, who is known to be the 
chief Bulwark of our Kingdoms,  



and upon whose undaunted Cou­
rage, Resolution and Conduct, our 
Liberties and Properties wholly 
depend; who vindicate our 
Rights with the expence of 
their dearest Blood. The un­
deserved Disappointments they 
have received, unknown to 
your Honour, for some Years past; 
and the many Losses they have 
sustain'd for want of good Instructi­
ons, has induced me to the great­
est part of this work, which I 
hope will be of good use to them 
if duly applyed. 

I don't mean there is any un­
just thing put upon them by 
their Superior Officers, who has 
a paternal care over them, but  



that they have not consulted a due 
Information for their own Interest. 

This I can safely say, the in­
forming of Sea-men was my only 
aim in this small Piece, when I 
first set my Resolutions upon it; 
but having a Manuscript by me, 
writ by the famous Sir John 
Narbrough,I was advis'd by 
some Friends to put some material 
and useful things therein menti­
oned, in this, which I have done 
exactly from the Original. 

 When I resolved to make this 
Piece publick, the Epistle Dedi­
catory was mainly in the choice 
of a Patron, to testify my esteem 
of those extraordinary Qualifica­



tions in you, that have gained 
the Affections of even the 
best and worst of Sea-men, for 
whose sakes I have dedicated it 
to you, who sit at the Helm of 
their Government, to guide and 
direct them in their true Course, 
not doubting but you will accept 
of the weak Labours of 

SIR,

Your Honours 
most humble Servant,
James Lightbody.
