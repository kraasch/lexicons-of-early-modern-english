The interpreta­
tion of straunge wordes, 
vsed in the translation
of Vigon.



ABietis.  Vigo 
in one of .ii. re­
ceytes, commaun
deth to take of
abietis. z.ii. & s 
where he mea­
neth the rasyn 
of the fyrre, or 
sapyne tree.
I haue red also, that the apotecaries
call palmam Elaten, wherof, the oyle
called oleum elatinum is made, palmam a­
bietem. Palma is a date tree, & abies a
fyr tree.

Aborcement 
Aborcement, is when a chylde is
borne out of season. 

Abstersiue 
Abstersiue is that, which hath po­
wer to scoure. 

Acacia.  
Acacia is a thornie tree growyng 
in Egipt, which hathe a whyte seede
cloosed in coddes, whereout a medi­
cenal iuce is pressed. And there issueth
also a gumme out of this tree, commenly
called gumme arabike: howebeit in the
stede of true acacia, they commenlye
vse the iuce of sloes. And therfore we
haue so translated it sometymes. 

Accidentes.  
An accident is that, that maye be in
a thyng, and away from the sayd thing
the selfe same thing remaynyng styll
vndistroyed. As vehement payne may
be an aposteme, or from it, withoute
remouynge of the aposteme. It soun­
deth worde for word, chaunsyng to. 

Acetositas citri.  
I dyd translate it ones or twyse,
the soure iuce of an orenge: howebeit
the apothecaries make this syrupe with
the iuce of a citron (as they haue she­
wed me) Natheles Fuchsius techeth
that they ben both of lyke vertue and
effect. And Io. Agricola sayth that citron
signifyeth an orenge, and also a limon.
And bycause this name is doutfull, I
leue it to thy iudgement, good reader,
whether thou wylt (when thou fyn­
dest the ryndes of a cytron, or the iuce)
vnderstand an orenge or a pome citron.

Acorus.  
Brunfelsus calleth acorum wild flour
delyse.  Mainarde sayth, that he was
wont to vse calamus aromaticus in
the stede of acorus. Some take it for 
galingale. 

Adiutorie.  
They call the two bones which ex­
tende from the shulders vnto the el­
bowes, ossa adiutoria. 

Aematites.  
Hematites is a precious stone, and
hath his name of bloody colour. For
Hema in Greke signifyeth bloode. It
hath strength to heate, to thynne, and
to scoure, and it is vsyd in medicines
for the eyes. 

Agarike.  
Some say, that Agaricum is a rote,
and some affirme, that it groweth to
trees lyke todestooles. It is founde
in wylde places of Sarmatia, and al
so in Galatia, and Cilitia, and it dry­
ueth out fleame and cholere, but not
spedely. 

Agrippa.  
Agrippa is an oyntment descrybed
in Galenes antidotari. 

Albugineus.  
Albugineus is that, that pertay­
neth to the whyte of the eye. 

Alchohol.  
The barbarous auctours vse al­
chohol, or (as I fynde it sometymes
wryten) alcofoll, for moost fyne pou­
dre. 

Alchachinga.

ya, for a kynde of thre leaued grasse,
which is soure in taste. 

Almocatim.  
The barbarous wryters calle the
nether bones of the heed Almocatim. 

Aloes.  
Aloe is the liquour of an herbe,
brought vnto vs out of India. Som
affirme, that the maner of makyng it
is this. They stampe the herbe, & draw
out the slymye iuyce, and lay it to the
fyre, tyll it boyle, and than they set it
a sunnynge, tyll it be drye. And that,
that is purest, they call succotrine, or
succocitrine, that which is in the mid­
dell, beinge lesse pure, hepaticke, and
fynally that which synketh to the bo­
tome, and is as it were the dregges,
they call Cabaline. Aloe is bytter in
taste, and of an hote and drye comple­
xion. It purgeth choler, and comfor­
teth the stomacke, and is moreouer
of greate effect in woundes. 

"succocitrine" not found in OED.



Althea.  
Dioscorides wrytteth, that Al­
thea is a kynde of wylde mallowes,
hauynge rounde leaues, and floures
lyke roses, it is commenlye taken for
holyhocke, and so I haue euer tran­
slated it. Howbeit the chirurgyens be­
yonde the see, vse marche mallowes
for Althea. 

Alumen zuccarinum. 
There bene manye kyndes of Alu­
mes: But thre bene mooste knowen,
which they communely call, Iamenum,
zuccharinum, or rotundum, and roch
alume. Alume hath vertue to bynde,
and therfore it is called Stipteria in
Greke, and it is moreouer abstersyue,
or scourynge. 

Ambrosine.  
Ambrosia is communelye taken
for wylde sage. 

"ambrosia" antedates the earliest OED citation of the herb associated with sage (1597).



Ameos.  Ameos. Ammi, in the genetiue case,
Ammeos is a whyte seede, hote, and
drye in the thyrde degre. It groweth
by the cytie of Egypte called Alexan­
dria. In stede of this herbe, some vse
the seed of cheruel. 

Amygdale.  
At the roote of the tonge, there
bene (as it were) two flesshye kernel­
les, lyke sponges, called in Greke pa­
risthmia, in latyne tonsille, and of the
later doctours amygdale, that is al­
mondes. 

Amydum.  
They corruptly vse this worde A­
mydum, for that, that is called in greke
Amylon, and it is the iuyce or mylke
of wheate steeped in water certayne
dayes, and afterwarde pressed. 

Anthera.  
Though Vigon thynketh An­
theram to be the yollowe in the myd­
dest of a rose, yet Cornelius Celsus,
sayeth that it is a composition for the
diseases of the mouthe, wherein ro­
ses entre. 

Anotamie.  
Anotamie is a Greke worde, and
sygnifyeth the cuttynge vp of a mans
bodye, or of some other thing. 

Anacardinum mel.  
They call the iuyce of anacardus
honye anacardine. And whan they
saye, that anacardus is the frute of
a tree called Pediculus Eliphantis,
whych groweth in Sicilia, and Apu­
lia. The honye or iuyce of this frute,
burneth bloode, and rooteth vp war­
tes. 

"anacardine" antedates the earliest OED citation (1585).



Animall spirites.  
Resorte to vitall spirites. 

Anodine.  
Thynges whiche are wythout
grefe, are caled in Greke, anodina.
Howbeit, Vigon vseth the word for
thynges that remoue payne.

Antecedent. Goynge before. 

Antidota.  
Antidota are medicines to be recey­
ued within the bodye. whereof there
bene thre dyfferences. For some are
gyuen agaynst poyson, some agaynst
the styngyng of venemous beastes,
or serpentes: and some heale diseases
gathered of corrupt meates, and drin­
kes. They call a boke wherein suche
medicynes are descrybed an antido­
tarie. 

Anthos.  
Anthos in Greke, sygnifyeth a
floure, howbeit, it is communely vsed,
for the floures of rosemarye. 

Antimonium 
Antimonium is a veyne of the earth
lyke leade, howbeit, it hath this diffe­
rence from a metal. A metal melteth,
Antimonium is brayed, and wyll be
burnt rather than molten, it is colde,
and drye in the thyrde degree. And it
is put in colliries for the eyes. &c. 

Anthrax.  
Anthrax is engendred when grosse
and boylyng blood, leanyng to some
part of the body, burneth the skynne.
For Anthrax in Greke, sygnifyeth a
coole: and for the same cause it is cal­
led carbunculus in latyne, which is a
diminitiue of carbo, a coole. 

Apium risus.  
Apium risus is taken from Batro­
chion, whiche is thought to be crow­
fote, & it is called Betrachion, or ranun
culus, bicause frogges delite therin.
And therfore the later auctours cal
it apium raninum. And they say that it is
called apium risus, bycause the man
that eateth therof, dyeth laughynge.
For risus signifieth laughing. which
auctours assigne to that, that grow­
eth in Sardinia. 

Aphorisme.  
Aphorismus signifieth a distinction.

Aposteme.  
Aposteme is a passion wherein the
thynges are sondred, whiche before
were ioyned togyther. wherfore ther
remayneth an emptye space, whyche
receyueth a wyndye or moyste sub­
staunce, or bothe. And the sayde sub­
staunce fretteth the partes about, ma­
kynde roume for hym selfe. In latyne
it is called abcessus. 

Aqua gariofilata.  
Aqua gariofilata is the water of
cloues: as it appeareth in the fourthe
boke of abridgementes. Howbeit, by
cause gariofilata is commenly taken
for ieloflours, for that, that they haue
the odour of cloues called gariophili
I thynke I dyd translate it ones, the
water of iellyflours. Here ye shal note
that though gariofillata be commen­
lye taken for iellofloures, yet other
well lerned men thinke it to be Auens,
and so perchaunce I haue translated
it sometymes. 

Armoniake.  
Dioscorides, calleth that, that
Vigon calleth armoniake, ammonia­
cum, of ammos, whyche sygnifyeth
sande. For it is the lyquour of a shrub
in Aphrica, called agafyllis, whyche
falleth vpon sande, and so is found in
clottes. Ammoniacum also is a kinde
of salte founde vnder sande. 

Arcula puerorum.  
Arcula puerorum. The later wryters
of chirurgeri, vsing an arabike terme
call the blysterynges, which through
corrupt mylke, happen in the roofe of
chylderens mouthes, Alcolam. Yf this
be not the disease whiche Vigon cal­
leth arculam. I can lerne of noman what
it shulde be. 

"blystertynges" antedates the earliest OED citation (1563).



Aristologia.  
Aristolochia hathe his name of that, that 
it helpeth greatly women in labour,
for the expulsyon of the secondes.
There bene two kyndes hereof, the
male, and the female. The male is
called longe, the female, rounde.






The roote of the Female is rounde,
lyke a rape, but the male is an ynche
thycke, and a span longe. Wyllyam
Turner a man (besydes his other ler­
ning, of excellent knowlege in herbes)
shewed me that he founde this herbe
in Italye with a frute fassyoned lyke
a pere: And he gaue me seedes to set,
howbeit, they prospered not. 

The term "seconds" in this sense appears not to be in OED.

it hath the colour of golde. And it is
digged oute of mynes, and hath ver­
tue to gnawe, to bynde, to represse.
It rayseth bladders lyke fyre, and fy­
nally it roteth vp heeres, and causeth
baldnesse. Vigon vseth arsenike, and
auripigmentum for .ii. thinges: whiche
difference I fynde not in lerned aun­
cient auctours.

Aromaticum rosatum.

forte the herte and the stomacke.

nesse in all the ioyntes of the body, a
noughty humour flowing to the same.
It is caled podagra, whan the hu­
mour is in the feete, & chiragra when
it is in the handes, Ischia dica (or as
they call it) sciatica, when it is about the
huclebone, whiche is called ischion in
Greke.

rounder. The floure of this herbe is
of purple colour, wherin there are see­
des lyke the stones of grapes. Thys
herbe healeth and prouoketh vryne.
Hermolaus Barbarus teacheth that
there is a difference betwene Asarum
& Bacchar, though theyr vertues are
lyke. Ruellius sayth that Bacchar is
called in the countrie, our ladyes glo­

leaues, and an hollowe stalke, and
whytysh in the toppe, wherof it hath
a pryckye heed.

and Aphrica, about the bignesse of an
hasel nutte, which frute being pressed
sendeth out a liquour, which they vse

Blattebisantie ben shel fyshes found
in India in waters, by whiche spike­
narde groweth, & they eate the spyke­
narde, and therfore haue a pleasaunt

vp, that haue the fallynge sycknesse.
The latynes call then vngues odo­
.

and by the colde of wynter, it is har­
dened. It is called in greke chrysocol­
la, as if you wold saye, the glue of gold

Bozomus.  
This worde Bozomus is found in
no good auctour, that euer I chaun­
ced to see. Bromus in greke signifieth
the corne which we call Otes, let the
reader iudge, whether Vigon vse bo­
zomus, for bromus.

Bruscus.  
Some thynke, that Bruscus is a
wilde myrt. It hath leaues prycking

the body through gret
inflammation dieth, but
is not yet perfitly deed
when it is perfytelye
deed, and without felynge: it is called
sphacelos in Greke, whiche they haue
turned to ascachillos, sideratio in la­

Chamepiteos.  
Chamepitys is communelye & fals­
lye taken for an herbe that groweth in
corne, of no odoure hauynge greyishe

nar councelleth to vse saynte Iohns
worre, in stede therof. The word soun­
deth, as you wolde saye a lowe pyne
tre, and it is an herbe hauynge the lea­
ues, and sent of a pyne tre, whych Ro­
berte Recorde a man for hys singuler
lernynge, and greate trauayle in ser­
chynge of herbes ryght worthie to be

I thynke that they haue corrupte the
worde and shulde saye Peucedanum,
whych hath a stalke lyke fenell, a ye­
lowe floure, and a blacke roote full of
liquor. Some call it feniculum porci­
num that is swynes fenell. There is a
iuyce gathered out of the tender rootes
thereof, beynge cutte wyth a knyfe,
whych is good for paynes of the heade,
and for the fallynge sycknesse. &c. The
whytyshe roote called of them Meon,
or men, for that, that Vigon calleth
pauce.

Pecten.  
Pecten is vsed of Vigon, for the bone
ouer the priuie membres.

Pectorall.  
Pectorall, Pertaynyng to the brest.

Pericranium.  
Bycause that Vigon speaketh ob­
scurelye aboute the Anatomie of the
heade we thought good here to adde
somewhat. The skynne that lyeth vn­
der the fyrste skynne of the heade, and
compasseth aboute the sculle, is called
pericranium. For peri in greke sygni­
fyeth aboute, & cranion a scull. There
ben thre seames, or commyssures in the
heade. Wherof two ben ouerthwart,
of whych one is in the foreparte of the
heade called Stephanea, or corona­
lis, the other is in the hynder parte of
the heade, and is called lambdoides,
bycause it is lyke thys lettre, Λ called
lambda in greke. The thyrde is stret­
ched from the myddel of the hynder, vnto
the myddell of the former, and is cal­
led in greke Obeliaea, in latyne sagit­
tallis. The fygure of these seames re­
presenteth thys letter H. The bones,
whyche ben sette at the eares on both
sydes, bene called Petrosa, in Greke








lithoeide, bycause they bene lyke stoo­
nes. About the temples there are two
seames called in greke lepidoeides, that
is lyke scales. Whan the brayne pan
is remoued, there appere two rymes,
or thynne skynnes, called in greke me­
ninges. The more outwarde of these
two is grosser, & defendeth the brayn
that it be not hurte agaynst the sculle.
& it is called dura mater. This rime
is bored thorough aboute the bones,
called in greke Ethmoeide, for that,
that they ben perced lyke a strayner,
or syffe, and spongreide, bycause they
ben ful of bones lyke a sponge, Vigo
calleth them Basilaria. The inner
ryme ioyned euen vnto the brayne is
thynner, and weaker than the other,
and it is lyke the skynne wherwith a
chylde is wrapped, in the moothers
woumbe, and therefore the grecians
calle it Choroeide, In latine it is cal­
led tenuis membrana, and pia mater.
The brayne it selfe is deuided into .ii.
partes, the former and the hynder.
The former is greater, & softer than
the hinder, and is deuided of dura ma­
ter. The hinder brayne lyeth to the
other, and therfore the egiptians call
it Paregcephalida, the latynes, by­
cause it is lesse than the other, haue na­
med it cerebellum. The two ventri­
cles of the former brayne labour out,
and finisshe the animalle spirite, and
sende it in to the hindre brain to cause
remembrance. Wherfore it was nede
full that a passage shulde be from them
vnto the hynder brayne, some cal this
passage, the common sense, some the
third ventricle. There leneth one this
passage of the brayne, a lytle particle
or piece after the manner of a vaulte,
bounchy without, and hollowe with
in, that there may be free space to mo­
tion and mouynge. The bodye or sub­
stance that adioyneth to this passage,
where the sayde passage hath his be­
gynnyng, is called conarion in greke,
bycause it resembleth a pyne apple na­
med conos. There lye aboute in the
sydes of the sayde myddle passage,
rounde bodies or substaunces, called
in greke, Gloutia, bycause they bene
lyke the buttockes of a man, some ly­
ken them to the stones.

But ther lieth ouer the passage of the
brayne a particle, which obteyneth a
circumscription lyke vnto a woorme
engendred in wood. And therfore the
Anatomistes call that bodye or sub­
stance, that couereth the hole passage,
Excrescentiam vermicularem, that is
the worme oute growyng. There pro­
cede oute of the myddle ventricle, or
chamber, two as it were condute py­
pes, deriuyng superfluyties vnto the
roofe of the mouth, and cummyng to
an hole, called infundibulum that is a
tunnelle, bycause it is large aboue, &
strayt beneth. There ben seuen payre
of synnowes, whiche growe from the
brayne. The fyrste .ii. pertayne to the
eyes, and gyue them facultie of seyng,
these are holowe, and softer than o­
ther synnowes, and they ioyne them
selues togyther, & agayne before they
enter into the eyes, they are deuyded,
representynge this greke letter .Χ.

The other payres are declared in Vi­
go. Finally rhete mirabile, or the mer­
ueylouse nette, is made of these arte­
ries, which come into the head wher­
as they, passyng ouer the scul, meete
at the fundation of the brayne . For
there, nature hathe prepared for this
nette, as it were a chambre, beyng en­
uyroned with the hard ryme dura ma­
ter. Into whiche place not a lytle por­
tion commeth of the arteries called ca­
rotides, or head arteries, whiche ar­
teries afterwarde ben dyuided in to a
plentuous generation, and so by those
goyng as it were lattese wyse, a form
of a nette is fasshoned.








Nowe that we haue spoken suffycy­
ently of the anatomie of the heed, we
wyll also speake somewhat of the o­
ther principall membres, and fyrste
of the herte.

The herte.   The hert on both sydes, aboute
the fundament of it, hath (as it were)
eares. The ryght eare with a notable
braunche is ioyned vnto the hollowe
veyne, and vnto the ryght ventricle of
the herte. The left eare is ioyned to the
mouth of the veynie arterie (called ve­
nosa arteria) and to the left ventricle
of the hert. For the hert hath two ven­
tricles, or chambres aryght, and a lefte
chambre, and they bene deuyded, and
parted atweine, through which perti­
tion there ben holes, by which, blood
is conueyed into the left ventricle. In
eche of the ventricles, there are two
vessels. For a noble veyne entreth in­
to the ryght ventricle, which bringeth
blood from the lyuer, and distributeth
it to all the veynes within, & without
the hert. And there commeth out of the
same venticle, an arterious veyne,
which caryeth blood to the longes.
It is called arteriosa vena, bycause
that in respect of his vse, it is a veine,
but in respecte of his two tunicles, or
skynnes, it is an arterie. A veynye
arterie is planted in the left venticle,
which bringeth ayre from the longes
to the herte. And it is called venosa
arteria, bycause that yf ye regard his
vse, it is an arterie, but yf ye regarde
his tunicle or skynne which is syngle,
and one onely, it is a veyne. The grea­

the streyght fylmes. Secondlye it re­
tayneth, and embraceth the meate be­
ing drawen in with the ouerthwart
fylmes. And it retayneth the meate
so longe, tyll by the alteratiue power
it is turned into good iuyce. Than the
stomake reserueth the beste for hys
owne noryshment, & dryueth downe
the rest vnto the guttes, and from thence
that, that is best is returned to the li­
uer, by the veynes called meseraicæ.
Howbeit that the lyuer shulde not ta­
rye to longe for hys meate, the sto­

Volubilis.  
There ben many kyndes of volubi­
lis, one hathe whyte floures lyke bel­
les, and wrappeth it self in hedges. A­
nother crepeth on the grounde, & wyn­
deth it self aboute herbes. The ger­
maines call volubilos winde, bycause
(I thynke) it wyndeth, and wrappeth
it selfe aboute bushes or herbes. I
founde it englished in an olde wrytten
boke hyehone.

Vitis alba.  
Vitis alba hath leaues, and braun­
ches like a set vine, and twyneth it self
aboute brambles, wyth hys tendrel­
les, as a vine byndeth it selfe to trees,
and it hathe clusters of redde coloure
lyke grapes, wherwyth men were
wonte to courie skynnes. The name
soundeth a white vine, and it is called
moreouer brionia. There is another
called nigra vitis, or a blacke vine, & it
hath leaues like yuie, & catcheth trees,
which grow nigh vnto him, with his
tendrelles, it beareth clusters, fyrste
grene, and afterwarde blacke, when
they ben rype, and it is called in latine
bryonia nigra, and vua tamina.

Vngula.  
Vngula is a sinnowye eminence of
the skynne of the eye called coniuncti­
ua, beginning at the greater corner of
the eye, and procedyng vnto the apple
of the eye, and when it is increased, it
couereth the apple also.

Vndimia.  
Vndimia is abarbarouse terme, in
greke it is called oedema, in latine tu­
mor. For it is a softe swellynge wyth­
out payne.

Vital spirites.  
A spirite is a subtile, fyne, aerye,
and cleare substaunce, produced of the
thynnest, and fynest parte of bloode,
that vertue, and strength maye be ca­
ried from the principal parte to the rest.
The physitions teache that there ben
thre kindes of spirites, animal, vital, &
naturall. The animal spirite hath his
seate in the brayne, and is spredde in
to all the bodye by synnowes, gyuyng
facultie of mouynge, and felynge. It
is called animal, bycause it is the first
instrument of the soule, whych the la­
tines call animam. And it is ingendred
of the vital spirite caried vp thither by
arteries, and there more parfectly di­
gested, and elaboured. For whyche pur­
pose nature made the merueylouse nette
in the brayne, as it were a chaungea­
ble, and manifolde mase. The vital spi­
rite is conteyned in the harte, and is
caried to the partes of the bodye, to
cause naturall heate. It is engendred
of inspiration, and of exhalation, or
outbreathinge of bloode. The natural
spirite dwelleth in the lyuer, and in the
veynes. Howbeit some alowe not the
addition of this spirite, beyng conten­
ted wyth the other two. Nowe that
we haue declared the spirites, we wil
speake somewhat of the natural facul­
ties. There ben thre faculties (I call a
facultie the cause wherof action or do
ynge procedeth) whych gouerne man,
and are distributed to the hole bodye,
as it were from an hedspringe, name­
ly animal, vital, and natural. The ani­
mal facultie is that, whyche sendeth fe­
lynge, and mouynge vnto al the bodie
from the brayne by sinnowes, as it
were by lytle pypes, or conduytes, &
moreouer it nourisheth vnderstanding,
& therfore the Grecians cal it logistice.
The vital facultie gyueth lyfe from the
harte by arteries vnto all the bodye, the
Grecians call it thymoeides, that is
fitte to be angry, or couragious. wher­
by it appeareth that the hart is the head­
sprynge of natural heate. The natural
facultie gyueth nouryshment to al the
partes of the bodye from the lyuer by
veynes, and is called of the grecians
epithymetrice, that is couetynge, or ap­








petyng, and also threptice, that is nou­
ryshynge. And it hath foure vertues
attractiue, retentiue, alteratiue, and
expulsiue. The attractiue vertue is that,
whyche can drawe such iuyce, as is a­
greable to the part, & the iuce is agrea­
ble, and fryndlye to the parte, whyche
is apte, and fit to be made lyke to the
sayd parte, and to fede the same. This
facultie ministreth matter wherby e­
uerye parte is nouryshed, and is as it
were an handmaide to the retentiue ver­
tue. The retentiue vertue is that whyche
retayneth the drawen iuyce, vntyll the
alteratiue vertue hathe chaunged it in
to the nature of the parte, that is nou­
ryshed, and so it serueth the alteratiue
vertue. The alteratiue vertue is that,
whyche altereth, chaungeth, and boy­
leth that, that is drawen, and retay­
ned a certayne space, and finallye ma­
keth it like, and ioyneth it to the parte,
that is nouryshed. The expulsiue ver­
tue sondreth straunge, and vnprofita­
ble thynges from concoction, and dry­
ueth superfluities out of euery part of
the bodye, leste they taryenge to longe
in the bodye, shulde rotte and putrifie.

And thys also, is a seruaunte to the
alteratiue vertue.

Vitriolum romanum 
Musa sayeth that vitriolum roma­
num is that, that Dioscorides calleth
Misy. whyche is founde in mynes, &
hath the colour of golde, and is harde,
and when it is broken it sendeth out the
golden sparcles shinynge lyke sterres.
It hathe vertue to purge, to heate, to
scoure awaye euyll corruption lyenge
in the corners of the eyes. when vitri­
olum is put wythout the addition of
thys worde romanum. Some vnder-
stande therby chalcantum whyche ye
shall seke in the lettre C.

Vuea.  
One of the skynnes of the eye is cal­
led vuea bycause it is lyke the stone of
a grape.

Vuula.  
In the extreme parte of the rouffe
of the mouthe, there appeareth han­
gynge a lytle peece of fleshe, whyche
some call columellam, some vuulum, that
is a lytle grape.

Xylobalsamum. 
The woode of bawme is called xy­
lobalsamum, the frute carpobalsamum,
the iuyce or liquor opobalsamum.

zeduarie.  
zeduaria is thought to be a roote of
hote, and drye temperamente, whyche
they seeth in wyne for the cough, for
paynes of the stomake. &c.

Of wieght. 
Libra or a pounde is deuided in to
twelue ounces. Here ye shal note, that
those apothecaries erre, whyche for a
pounde put sixtene ounces into theyr
medicines. For that is the marchaun­
tes pounde. The fourthe parte of a
pounde, is called quadrans in latine,
the thyrde triens, the sixte, sextans.
wherfore quadrans, or a quarterne is
the weyght of thre ounces. Triens of
four. Sextans of two. An ounce maketh
viii.. drammes, a dram .iii. scruples. And
as the comune practicioners say .lx. bar­
ley cornes make a dramme. Granum
is the weyght of a grayne. Manipu­
lus signifieth an handfull. Here folow
the notes of these weyghtes.
