Psal. 118.

Da mihi intellectum, & scrutabor legem tuam, & custodiam
illam in toto meo.

That is,

Giue me vnderstanding, and I wil searche thy law, and
wil keepe it with my whole hart.

S. Aug. tract. 2. in Epist. Ioan.

Omnia qua leguntur in Scripturis sanctis, ad instructionem & salutem nostrum intentè oportes
audire: maxime tamen memoria commendanda sunt, qua aduersus Hæreticos valent plu­
rimùm: quorum insidia, infirmiores quosque & negligentiores circumuenire non cessant.

That is,

Al things that are readde in holy Scriptures, we must heare with great attention, to our
instruction and saluation: but those things specially must be commended to me­
morie, which make most against Heretikes: whose deceites cease not to cir­
cumuent and beguile al the weaker sort and the more negligent persons.
