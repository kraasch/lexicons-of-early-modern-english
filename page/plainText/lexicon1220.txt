TO HIS 
Honoured FRIEND
Peter Courthope, Esq;
OF
DANNY in SUSSEX.

Sir,
THough I need no other
Motive to induce me
to present you with this
Collection of English Words,
but that I might take occasion
publickly to own my Obligati­
ons to you, as well for your





long continued Friendship as for
the Assistance you have some­
time afforded me in those Studies
to which I am I think naturally
inclined, yet one Circumstance
did more especially lead me to
make choice of you for its Pa­
tron; and that is, that you were
the first that Contributed to it,
and indeed the Person that put
me upon it; and so it being in 
good measure your own, I have
reason to hope that you will
Favourably accept it. I confess
the Work is so inconsiderable,
that I am somewhat ashamed to
prefix your name before it, but
having nothing else left of my
own, which I design to trouble
the World with, as not knowing





whether I may live so long as to
perfect what I have now before
me; I chuse rather to present you
with this, than lose the Honour
of being known to have such a
Friend, or neglect the duty of
making acknowledgments where
they are due, especially having
already made Presents of this
Nature to others of my Friends,
which is enough to excuse this
Dedication intended to do other
purposes by

Sir,

Your very humble Servant,

JO. RAY.











THE 
PREFACE.

Since the publishing this Collecti­
on of Local Words, in the year 
1674. which were hastily ga­
thered up by me, I received a 
Letter from my worthy Friend M. Fran­
cis Brokesby, sometimes Fellow of Tri­
nity College in Cambridge, and since 
Rector of Rowley in the East Riding 
of Yorkshire, attended with a large 
Catalogue of Northen Words, their 
significations, and Etymologies, to be 
added to a second Edition of this Col­
lection, if ever it came to be reprinted; 
which then I did not expect that it 
would. But since it hath found so 
favourable acceptance among the inge­
nious, that the former Impression be­






ing disperst and exhausted, a new one 
is desired by the Bookseller concerned: 
I readily entertained the motion, that 
I might enrich my Book, and recom­
mend it to the Reader by so consider­
able an Addition, as also procure my 
Friend the praise due to his pains 
and performance. And lest I my self 
should defraud him, and intervert any 
part thereof, I hold my self obliged to 
advertise the Reader, that the greatest 
part of the Words added to the Nor­
thern Collection are owing to him, 
though his name be not subjoyned. The 
rest are a supplement of such Words ob­
served by the learned and ingenious, 
my honored and dear Friend Dr. Tan­
cred Robinson as he found wanting in 
Mr. Brokesbyes Catalogne. The great­
est part of the additional Words in the 
Southern Collection were contributed 
by my ingenious Friends Mr. Nicolas 
Jekyll of Sibble Heveningham, and 
Mr. Mansell Courtman Minister of 
Castle Heveningham in Essex. Since 
the Copy of this Collection was out of 






my hands, and delivered to the Book­
seller in order to the Printing of it, I 
received three Catalogues of Local 
Words, two from my learned and wor­
thily esteemed Friend Mr. Edward 
Lloyd of Oxford, one drawn up by 
himself, of British Words parallel to 
some of the Northern Words in this 
Collection, from which probably the 
Northern might be derived: the other 
communicated to him by Mr. Tomlin­
son of Edmund Hall, a Cumberland 
Gentleman. The third from Mr. Wil­
kinson a Bookseller in Fleetstreet, 
London, owner of the Copy of this 
Collection, sent him from Mr. Wil­
liam Nicholson, an ingenious Mini­
ster living in Cumberland. I found in 
it many Words already entred in my 
Collection, the most of which I thought 
fit to omit, though had they come time­
ly enough they might have been useful 
to me, because they contain many pa­
rallels in the Teutonick, Cimbrick, 
and old Gothick Languages, which 
might have been added in their places.






Some Words, I also observed therein of 
common and general use in most coun­
tries of England, at least where I 
have lived or conversed, which I also 
omitted, (because it is not my design 
to write an English Glossary) but yet 
shall here mention them.

Benison  for Benediction, which is 
not unusual among our Elegant Wri­
ters.

Blume,  or Bloom for Blossome.

A Bowre,  for an Arbour, because 
made of Bows, or as they usually spell 
it, Boughs of Trees: though I confess 
with us it is used neither for a House 
nor for a Room.

A Brigge,  for a Bridge used at Cam­
bridge. It is but a difference of Dia­
lect.

Childermas day,  for Innocents day.

A Corse,  for a dead body, which 
in my opinion is originally nothing but 
Corps.

A Cragge,  probably from the British 
Craig.

To Cun, or Con thanks:  to give 
thanks.
 Sense of "cun(v)" and "con(v)" not found in OED. 






Deft,  for Neat, pretty.

Fangs,  for Claws Clutches, is a 
general Word.

To Fleer  or Flyre, to laugh slily, to 
jeer.

Gear  or Geer, for clothes, accou­
trements, harness. So Women call the 
Linnen and what else they wear upon 
their Head, Head-gear: Gear is al­
so used for trumpery, rubbish, so as 
stuffe is. Goodly gear.

A Glead,  for a Kite, which he very 
probably deduces from gliding.

Grave The Word Grave is not used in the 
South for digging wuth a Spade, but is 
appropriated to cutting upon Metal. 
But a Grave i.e. Sepulchrum is a 
Pit digged with a Spade, and we say 
a Spade-graft or a Spit deep. And a 
Groove is a Furrow made in Wood or 
Metal by Joyners, Smiths, or other 
Artificers.

Groats,  for great Oatmeal is a ge­
neral Word.

Gripe,  the same with Grupe, is 
frequently used with us for fulcus, fos­
sula, illex..






Harrying the Country,  is also ge­
nerally used for wasting, plundering, 
spoiling it by any means. There is a 
sort of Puttock called a Hen-harrier 
from chasing, preying upon and destroy­
ing of Poultry.

Than Hie you,  for hast you, nothing 
wore common.

Lugs,  for Ears is a general but 
derisory Word. With Hair in Cha­
racters and Lugs in text. Cleve­
lands Poems.

Neb,  is of frequent use, though not 
for the Nose of a Man, yet for 
the Bill of a Bird, and metaphorically 
for the point of a Pen, or the long 
and slender Nose of any Vessel.

To Nip,  for to press between the 
Fingers and Thumb not using the 
Nails, or with any Instrument that is 
flat as Tongs or the like: to press be­
tween things that are edged, is called 
pinching.

A Reek,  with us signifies not a 
Smoak, but a steam arising from any 
Liquor or moist thing heated.






Sad,  is used also for heavy, spoken 
of Bread that rises not, or the like.

A Strand,  for a Shoar or bank of 
Sand, whence the Strand in Lon­
don; and a Ship is said to be Strand­
ed.

Uncouth,  is commonly used for ab­
surb, incongruous.

Warre,  for beware, as War Heads, 
or Horns.

Wented,  for acid or a little changed, 
spoken of Wort.

To Whittle sticks,  to cut off the Bark 
with a Knife, to make them white. 
Hence also a Knife is in derision cal­
led a Whittle.

Wilie,  Subtle, deceitful.

I was the less scrupulous of omit­
ting these Words, because the Gentle­
man himself intends to publish with a 
History of the Kingdom of North­
umberland a large North-humbrick 
Glossary.

To these I might add some Words 
I observed in Mr. Hickes his Islan­
dish Dictionary, by him noted for






Northern Words, v. To Banne,  i.e. 
to Curse. To make a Dinne,  i. e. a 
Noise, which we in Essex pronounce 
Dean, and is in frequent use. A Fang,  
for a Claw or Paw. A Frosh,  for a 
Frog. Galts  and Gelts, or as they 
here pronounce it Yelts, for young Sows 
before they have had their first Fare 
of Pigs. To Yell.  i.e. to cry out 
hideously, to howl. To Glow,  i.e. to 
be hot. To Heave,  i.e. to lift up. 
The Huls of Corn , i.e. the chaffe or 
covering from Hill to cover. To 
Lamme,  i.e. to beat.

These Gentlemen being, I suppose 
North Country Men, and during their 
abode in the Universities or elsewhere, 
not happening to hear those Words used 
in the South, might suppose them to be 
proper to the North. The same error I 
committed my self in many Words that 
I put down for Southern, which after­
wards I was advised were of use also 
in the North, viz. Arders, Auk and 
aukward, to Brimme, Bucksome, 
Chizzel, Clever, a Cob-iron, a Cot-­






terel, to Cour down, to Cope, Crank, 
it Dares or Dears, a Dibble, a Dool, 
Feaberries, to Goyster, Hogs for 
Sheep, a Jarre, to Play, i.e. to Boyl, 
Shie, Temse-bread.

In the same Islandish Dictionary 
I find also some Northern Words not 
entred in my Catalogue, viz.

The Eand, Spiritus, à Cimbrico 
Ande. To Byg, ædificare; Bigd ha­
bitatio. To Britten Beef, to break 
the Bones of it. AS. Brittan fran­
gere. The Ey-brees, Palpebræ Ey­
lids. Scot. Bran abIsland, Brun. We 
use Eybrows for Supercilia. To 
Dwine away, Gradatim perire, inde 
Dwindle Dimin. à Duyn Islandico, 
Cesso, deficio. Easles, Boreal. Isles, 
Cinis ignitus, scintillans abIsland. 
Eysa. We in Essex use Easles for the 
hot Embers, or as it were burning 
Coals of Straw only. A Fell, mons. 
Fournes fells, The Fell-foot. ab
Islandico Fel, Acclivitas.

Fliggurs Ebor. Young Birds that 
can fly, fledge, Isl. Fleigur Volatilis.






The Gowk,  the Cuckow, Island. 
Gaukur.

Nowt-geld,  Tributum pro pecore 
solutum.

A Nab,  Summitas rupis vel montis. 
Island. Gnypa.

Heasy,  Raucus, Isl. Hæse Ranci­
tas.

To Helle water . Effundere aquam. 
Island. Helle, heltre, fundo.

A Whreak,  Tussis, a hauking, Scre­
atio. Island. Hroak, Sputum.

To Ream,  manum ad aliquid capi­
endum exporrigo. Island. Hremme, 
Unguibus rapio.

To Reouse,  commendare.

Axel-tooth,  Dens molaris, Island 
jaxl, idem.

Yaud Eboracensibus  a Horse, a 
Jade.

To Lek,  Stillo, Island. Lek.

The Fire lowes,  i. e. flames Ebora­
censibus. Germ. Lohe, Flamma.

The Munne,  the Mouth. Island. 
Munnur.

In Sir Tho. Browns eighth Tract,






which is of Languages, there are se­
veral Words mentioned as of common 
use in Norfolk, or peculiar to the East-­
Angle Countries, and not of general, 
viz. Bawnd, Bunny, Thurk, Enem­
mis, Sammodithee, Mawther, Kedge, 
Seel, Straft, Clever, Matchly, Dere, 
Nicked, Stingy, Non eore, Feft, 
Thepes, Gosgood, Camp, Sibrit, 
Fangast, Sap, Cothish, Thokish, 
Bide owe, Paxwax.

Of some of these the forementioned 
Mr. Hickes gives an account in the 
Preface to his Saxon Grammar, as 
Bunny, a swelling upon a stroke or 
blow on the Head or elsewhere, which 
he parallels with the Gotthick Bango
uteus, and the Islandick Ban, a Wound, 
and Ben vibex. We in Essex call it 
a Boine on the Head. Bunny is also 
used as a flattering word ύποκοριϛι­
κόν to Children. Bawnd tumens, as 
his Head is bownd, his head is swoln, 
from the forementioned Islandick word 
Bon. Thurk or Thark is plainly 
from the Saxon deork, dark Enem­






mis, nè, ne forte, as Spar the door 
Enemmis he come, i. e. lest he come, he 
deduces probably from Eigenema or 
Einema an adverb of excluding or ex­
cepting now in use among the Islanders. 
Sammodithu, a form of salutation sig­
nifying, tell me how do you, pro­
bably may be nothing but the Saxon 
sæg me hu dert þu, rapidly pronounc'd, 
as we say Muchgooditte for Much 
good do it you. Mauther I take to 
be our Mothther a Girl or young Maid, 
of which I rather approve Sir Hen. 
Spelmans account, which see in my 
Collection. Seel, Tempus, entred in 
the Collection. Strast, iratus, irâ excla­
mans, Islandis at Straffa est objurgare, 
corripere, increpare. Matchly; Per­
fectly well. Islandis Maatlega, Magt­
lega; Sax. Mihtilice, valdè, mightily. 
To Dere or Dare, entred in the Col­
lection. Noneare, modò. Isl. Nunær. 
[ere seems to signifie in old English be­
fore as in Ere-now and in Erewhile, 
i.e. before now, before time, and ere 
I go, i.e, before I go, of which yore






seems to be but a Dialect, in days of 
yore. So non-ere may be not before, 
now] To Camp. To play at Foot­
ball. Sax. Camp is striving, and Cam­
pian to strive or contend. This word, 
for this exercise, extends over Essex 
as well as Norfolk and Suffolk. Si­
brit is entred in the Collection. This 
Author makes it a compound of Sib and 
byrht manifest. Angl. to Bruit, apud 
Salopienses to Brit, to Divulge and 
spread abroad: I should rather make 
it a compound of Sib and ritus. Fan­
gast, a marriageable Maid, viro ma­
tura & q. virum jam expetens: per­
chance from fengan or fangan, Sax. 
to take or catch, and aast love, as 
much to say as taken with love or 
capable of love. To bide owe, pœnas 
dare: unde constat (saith he) bide pro­
fluxisse à Saxonico wyte, quod pœnam 
mulctam, supplicium significant. The 
other words which he leaves to others to 
give an account of are Kedge for brisk 
budge; clever, neat, elegant. See the 
Collection: to nick, to hit the time right






I nick'it, I came in the nick of time, 
just in time. Nick and Notch, i.e. 
crena are synonymous words, and to 
nick a thing seems to me to be origi­
nally no more than to hit just the notch 
or mark, scopum petere: Stingy, 
pinching, sordid, narrow-spirited, I 
doubt whether it be of ancient use or 
Original, and rather think it to be a 
newly coined word. To feft, to per­
suade, or indeavour to persuade. We 
in Essex use feffing for putting, thrust­
ing or obtruding a thing upon one, do­
num or Merces obtrudere, but for 
the Etymon or Original I am to seek: 
Gosgood, i.e. Yeast or Barm, is no­
thing but Gods-good, (Bonum Di­
vinum) as they pronounce the word in 
Sussex and Kent, where it is in use; 
it is also called Beer-good. Thepes 
is the same with Febes or Feaberries, 
i.e. Goose-berries, a word used also in 
Cheshire, as Gerard witnesseth in his 
Herbal; but what Language it owes 
its Original to is further to be enquired. 
Cothish, Morose, and Thokish, sloth­






ful, sluggish, I have no account to give 
of. Paxwax, for the Tendon or apo­
neurosis to strengthen the Neck, and 
bind the Head to the Shoulders, I have 
nothing to say to, but that it is a word 
not confined to Norfolk or Suffolk, 
but far spread over England; used to 
my knowledge in Oxfordshire.

As for the Catalogues of English Birds 
and Fishes inserted in the first Editi­
on of this Book, I thought fit to omit 
them in this; because they were very 
imperfect, and since much more fully 
given in the Histories of Birds and 
Fishes published by us; besides if God 
grant life and health I may put forth 
a particular methodical Synopsis of our 
English Animals and Fossills with Cha­
racteristick Notes, and Observations 
upon them, which will swell to a con­
siderable Volume, our Insects being more 
numerous than the Plants of this Island.














A
COLLECTION
OF
Local Words
Proper to the
NORTH and SOUTH Countries.





A.

TO Adle  or Addle; to Earn, from 
the ancient Saxon word Ed-lean, 
a reward, recompence or re­
quital.
      
After-math;  the Pasture after the Grass 
hath been mowed. In other places called 
Roughins.

Agate;  Ches. Just going, as I am A­
gate. Gate in the Northern Dialects signi­






fies a way, so that a Agate is at or upon the 
way.

Alantom;  At a distance.

A mell;  Among, betwixt, contracted 
from a middle; or perchance from the 
French word Mesler, signifying to mingle, 
whence our English Medley is derived. 
Some pronounce it ameld.

Anauntrins;  If so be. I know not what 
the Original of this should be, unless it be 
from An, for if, and Auntrins contracted 
from Peradventure.

Anent;  Over against, concerning. A 
word of frequent use among the Scots. 
Some deduce it from the Greek ϲναντί, ϲναντίον
Oppositum. Nec malè sanè (inquit Skinne­
rus in Etymologico Linguae Anglicanae) si 
vel soni vel sensus convenientiam respicias. 
Sed quo commercio Græci Scotis totius Eu­
ropæ longitudine dissitis vocabula impertiri po­
tuerunt? Mallem igitur deducere ab AS 
Nean Prope, additâ particulâ initiali otio­
sa A.

An Arain;  a Spider: à Lat. Aranea. It 
is used only for the larger kind of Spiders. 
Nottinghamshire.

Arf;  Afraid.
 "arf(a)" not found in OED. 

An Ark;  A large Chest to put Corn or 
Fruit in like the Bing of a Buttery; from 
the Latin word Arca.






Arles or Earles;   Earnest, an Arles-penny, 
an Earnest-penny, from the Latin Word 
arrha.

An Arr;  A Skar. Pock-arrs, the Marks 
made by the Small Pox. This is a gene­
ral Word, common both to North and 
South.

Arvill-Supper;  A Feast made at Fune­
rals: in part still retained in the North.
 "arvill-supper(n)" not found in OED. 

An Aiker;  a Newt, or Eft, Salamandra 
aquatica.
 "aiker(n)" not found in OED. 

Astite;  Anon. shortly, or as soon. i.e. 
As Tide, Tide in the North signifies soon, 
and tider or titter sooner. The tider (that 
is the sooner) you come, the tider you'll go; 
from the Saxon Tid, signifying time, which 
is still in use, as in Shrove-tide, Whitsun­
tide, &c.

As Asly;  As willingly.

An Attercob;  A Spiders Web. Cum­
berland.

Aud-farand;  Children are said to be so, 
when grave or witty, beyond what is usual 
in such as are of that age.

Aud;  Old. Var. Dial. as Caud for Cold, 
Wauds for Wolds, Aum for Elm. And Fa­
rand the Humor or Genius, Ingenium.

Average;  The breaking of Corn Fields; 
Eddish, Roughings. Average in Law 
signifies either the Beasts which Tenants 






and Vassals were to provide their Lords 
for certain Services, or that Mony that 
was laid out by Merchants to repair the 
Losses suffered by Shipwrack; and so it is 
deduced from the old word Aver [Averi­
um] signifying a laboring Beast: or Ave­
ria signifying Goods or Chattels, from the 
French Avoir to have or possess. But in 
the sense we have used it, it may possibly 
come from Haver signifying Oats; or 
from Averia, Beasts, being as much as 
Feeding for Cattle, Pasturage.

Aum;  Elm. Var. Dial.

An Aumbry, or Ambry, or Aumery.  A 
Pantry or Cupboard to set Victuals in: 
Skinner makes it to signifie a Cupboard's 
Head, or Side-Table: super quam vasa 
mensaria & tota argentea supellex ad usum 
conviviorum exponitur: à Fr. G. Aumoire, 
Armaire, & Armoire, It. Armaro idem sig­
nantibus, q. d. Latinè Armarium. Prov. 
No sooner up, but the head in the Aumbry, 
and Nose in the Cup. In which Sentence 
it must needs signifie a Cupboard for Vi­
ctuals.

Aund;  Ordained: forsan per contractio­
nem. I am aun'd to this luck, i.e. Ordain'd.
 "aund(a)" not found in OED. 

Aunters;  Peradventure, or, in case, if 
it chance. I guess it to be contracted from 
Adventure, which was first mollified into 






Auventure, and then easily contracted in­
to Aunter. It signifies also needless Scru­
ples, in that usual Phrase, He is troubled 
with Aunters.

The Aunder, or as they pronounce it in 
Cheshire, Oneder;  The Afternoon.

Awns;  Aristæ, The Beards of Wheat or 
Barley. In Essex they pronounce it Ails.


B. 

A Backstex;  A Baker.
 "backstex(n)" not found in OED. 

A Badger;  Such as buy Corn, or 
other Commodities in one place, and 
carry them to another. It is a Word of 
general use.

Bain;  Willing, Forward: opposed to 
Lither.

The Balk or Bawk;  The Summer­
beam, or Dorman, Balks, Bawks: Poles 
laid over a Stable or other Building for the 
Roof, à Belgico, & Teuton. Balk, Trabs, 
tignum. In common speech a Balk is the 
same with Scamnum in Latin, i.e. a piece 
of Land which is either casually over­
slip'd, and not turned up in plowing, or 
industriously left untouched by the Plow, 
for a Boundary between Lands, or some 
other use. Hence to balk, is frequently






used metaphorically, for to pass over.

A Balk staff;  A Quarter-staff, a great 
Staff like a Pole or Beam.

A Bannock;  An Oat-cake kneaded with 
Water only and baked in the Embers. In 
Lancashire, and other parts of the North, 
they make several sorts of Oaten bread, 
which they call by several Names: as 1. 
Tharcakes, the same with Bannocks, viz. 
Cakes made of Oat-meal, as it comes from 
the Mill and fair Water, without Yeast 
or Leaven, and so baked. 2. Clap-bread: 
Thin hard Oat-cakes. 3. Kitchiness-bread: 
Thin soft Oat-cakes made of thin Batter. 
4. Riddle-cakes: thick Sour-cakes, from 
which differs little that which they call 
Hand-hoven Bread, having but little Lea­
ven, and being kneaded stiffer. 5. Jan­
nock, Oaten bread made up in Loaves.
 "kitchiness-bread(n)" not found in OED. 

A Bargh;  A Horseway up a steep Hill, 
York-shire.

A Barn or Bearn;  A Child. It is an an­
cient Saxon word. In the ancient Teu­
tonick, Barn signifies a Son, derived per­
chance from the Syriack Bar, Filius.

A Barr;  A Gate of a City. York. As 
Bootham Bar, Monk-bar, Michael Gate-Bar 
in the City of York.

Bawaty  or Bowety; Linsey-Wolsey.

Bearn-teams;  Broods of Children, as 






they expounded it to me. I find that 
Bearn-team in the Saxon, signifies Issue, 
Offspring, Children, from team, soboles, and 
Bearn. A teeming Woman is still in use 
for one that is apt to bear Children.

Bearing with Child;  Breeding, gravid. 
York-shire.

A Beck;  a small Brook. A Word com­
mon to the ancient Saxon, High and Low 
Dutch and Danish. Hence the Termina­
tions of many Towns, Sand beck, Well­
beck, &.

Beeld;  Shelter.

Beer or Birre; q. Beare;  Force, might. 
With aw my Beer. Cheshire. i.e. With all 
my Force.

Beight of the Elbow;  Bending of the

stum Feviæ Mr. Ni­
colson. So that Yule 
is originally no­
thing else but Vigi­
liæ, as Mr. Lloyd 
rightly judgeth.

30. [British] Gwìliay,  i­
dem: which ac­
cording to the Welsh 
Syntax is sometimes 
Wiliay. Properly it 
signifies only Holy­
days, and is doubt­
less derived from 
the Latine word Vi­
giliæ.

31. [English] A Fowmart,  
a Polecat. Martes 
is a noted Beast of 
this verminous kind, 






desired for their 
Furs; whence per­
chance the Polecat 
might be denomi­
nated Foumart q. 
Foul mart from its 
stinking smell.

31. [British] Phw'lbart,  i­
dem.

32. [English] Durdom,  noise.

36. [British] Elkys,  Wild

Goose-grease, but 
in general any kind 
of Grease or Sewet 
or Oil, wherewith 
our Clothiers a­
noint or besmear 
their Wool to make 
it run or draw out 
in Spinning. It is 
a general word in 
most Countries.

37. [British] Saim,  Grease, 
of the same Foun­
tain doubtless with 
the Latine word Se­
bum. I should ra­
ther think with the 
Hebrew Shamen 
Pinguèdo. Sevum
not being a general






word for Fat or 
Grease, but proper 
for Tallow or hard 
Fat.

38. [English] Spokes  of a 
Wheel.

38. [British] Yspagay,  Legs, 
used also metapho­
rically for the feet

Sword or Bill.

39. [British] Glaìv,  a Bill,

make a difference 
between a Riddle & 
a Sieve. A Riddle 
is of an oblong fi­
gue, whereas a Sieve 
is round: and a 
Riddle is made of 
round Wickers 
placed longways 
one by another, 
whereas a Sieve is 
made of thin long 
Plates, as it were 
woven together, so 
that the holes of it 
are four-square.

A Catalogue of North Country 
Words received from Mr. Tom­
linson of Edmund Hall, a Cum­
berland Gentleman, and com­
municated to me by the same 
Mr. Edward Lloyd.


A Beck,  a Rivulet or small Brook. This 
Word is already entred among the 
Northern words; and noted to be common to 
the ancient Saxon, High and Low Dutch, 
and Danish. It is used not only in the North, 
but in some Southern and Western Coun­
ties; and gives denomination  to some Towns, 
as Welbeck, Sandbeck, Troutbeck.

Bourn or Burn,  a Rivulet or Spring. 
This is also common to some Southern Coun­
ties, and gives denomination to many Towns, 
as Sherburn, Milburn, &c.

Bore-tree,  Elder-tree: from the great 
pith in the younger branches which Chil­
dren commonly bore out to make Pot­
guns of them.






Bracken,  Fern. ab Angl. Break, be­
cause when its moisture is dried up it is 
very brittle. A Brake is an instrument 
to break Flax with, of the same original. 
Break comes from the Saxon Brecan. Brake 
Fern is a general word all England over; 
and better known in this Country [Essex] 
then Fern; indeed the only word in use a­
mong the Vulgar, who understand not Fern. 
Bracken is but the plural of Brake, as Eyn 
of Ey, and Peasen of Pease. &c.
	
Brent-brow,  a steep Hill, Metaph. The 
brow of a Hill, Supercilium, the edge or 
side of a Hill or Precipice.

A Brock,  a Badger. This is a word 
known in most Countries. The Ani­
mal is trionymous, Badger, Brock or 
Gray.

To Coop or Cowp.  To chaffer or ex­
change. It is a Low Dutch word. That 
which is given by the party which hath 
the worst Goods is called boot; as What 
Root will you give me between your old 
Yawd and my Filly? i.e. between your 
old Mare and my young one: ab AS. 
Bot reward or recompense. To boot is used 
frequently in the same sense all England over. 
Boot signifies profit, as in that impersonal 
Verb, It booteth not, It profiteth, helpeth 
or availeth not.






Copt-know,  The top of a Hill rising 
like a Cone or Sugar-Loaf. Copt I 
conceive, comes from Caput, and Know 
or Knolle is the top of a Hill.
 "copt(n)" and "copt-know(n)" not found in OED. 

A Cowdy,  a little Cow, a Scotch Runt 
without Horns, or else with very short 
ones, scarce exceeding a South-Country 
Veal in height:  So that the word is only a 
diminutive of Cow.

A Creil,  a short, stubbed, dwarfish man. 
Northumberland.

A Croft,  a small Close or inclosure, at 
one end whereof a dwelling House with 
a Garth or Kitchin-Garden is usually 
placed: ab AS. Croft, Agellulus. Croft 
for any small Field or inclosure in ge­
neral, without any respect to a Mansion 
House, is common in all Counties of Eng­
land.

Cyphel,  Houseleek.

A Dish-Cradle or Credle,  a wooden U­
tensil for wooden Dishes, much in use in 
the North of England, made usually like 
a Cube or Die, and sometimes like a Pa­
rallelipipedon, long Cube; or Cradle, 
Cumber.

A Dike,  a Ditch, this is only a variety 
of Dialect. Though it seems Dyke and 
Seugh or Sough are distinguished in the 
North, a Dyke being a Ditch to a dry






Hedge, either of Trees or Earth, as in 
arable Lands, where the Ditch is usually 
dry all Summer; but a Sough a Ditch brim­
ful of water, as in Meadows or Sow­
brows are not above 1/2 yard in height. A 
Sough is a subterraneous vault or channel cut 
through a Hill to lay Coal Mines or any other 
Mine dry.

A Dubler or Doubler,  a Platter or Dish. 
Vox per magnam Anglia partem diffusa.

Draffe,  the Grains of Malt, à Belg. 
Draf ejusdem significati. This is a ge­
neral word, signifying not only Grains, but 
Swill, as in those Proverbs, Draffe is good 
enough for Swine, and, The still Sow 
eates up all the Draffe.

A Fowmart,  a Polecat or Fitchet: Brit. 
Ffwlbarth. This is entred in the Col­
lection.

A Gill,  a place hem'd in with two steep

Brushwood, a rivulet running between 
them. It's entred in the Collection.

A Geose or Grose cree;  a Hut to put 
Geese in.

A Gob,  an open or wide mouth. Hence 
to goble, to swallow greedily, or with 
open mouth. Gob in the South signifies a 
large morsel or bit, so we say a good Gob 
i.e. a good Segment or part. The diminu­






tive whereof is Gobbet; cut into gobbets, 
perchance from the Greek word ϰόπτα,
ϰόμμα.

A Gully;  a large household Knife.

A Gavelock,  an iron Crown, ab AS. 
Gaveloc. catapulta, balista. Already 
entred.

Hadder,  Heath or Ling.

The Hollen,  is a wall about 2 1/2 yards 
high, used in dwelling Houses to secure 
the Family from the blasts of wind, rushing 
in when the heck is open, To this Wall 
on that side next to the Hearth is annex'd 
a Sconce or Skreen of Wood or Stone.

Hen-bawks,  A Hen Roost, from the 
Bawks of which it consists. v. Bawks.

A Knor or Knurre,  a short stubbed 
dwarfish Man. Metaph. from a Knor, 
or Knot in a Tree. In the South we use 
the Diminutive Knurle in the same sense.

A Keil of Hay,  a Cock of Hay.  
Northumberl.

A Losset,  a large flat wooden dish not 
much unlike a Voider.

A Mould warp,  a Mole, Mold in the 
Saxon is dust, in English Mould is used for 
Earth, especially among Gardeners. 
Worpen in Low Dutch is cast forth, 
whence to wort is to cast forth as a 
Mole or Hog doth. This is a word known






all over England, though not in frequent 
use.

A Mell,  a wooden sledge or Beetle, ab
AS, Mell, Crux, from the exact resem­
blance of the Head and Shaft (or handle) 
especially before the upper part of the 
Shaft is cut off, to a Cross. Hence Mel­
deors (or Doors) a passage through a 
dwelling house. For in the North parts 
of England the Houses of those of the in­
ferior sort have a passage through them 
with a Door or Heck on one side into the 
dwelling House, and another on the other 
side into the Byer, where they bind their 
Cows, Oxen, &c. lengthways on each 
side. This Byer hath a Grupe, Groop or 
Fossula in the midst from the Door to 
the other end: so that the Fossula from the 
Door to the other end represents the 
Shaft of a Mell; or the streight Tree 
in a cross, and the passage though the 
House the Head or transvers Tree.

A Porr,  a  Glasier or Plummer, a Sala­
mander.

Pot-cleps,  Pot-hooks, from clip or clap, 
because they clap or catch hold of the 
Pot.

Tup-Hog is a Ram of one year old: a 
Gimmer-hog, an Ewe of the same age. 
A twinter is a Hog two years old.

A Roop,  a Hoarseness: à Cimbrico 
Hroop vel Heroop, vociferatio, by which it 
is frequently contracted.

Smidy,  a Smiths Shop, whence Smidy­
koom. Var. Dial.

A Steg,  a Gander.

To Slam one,  to beat or cuffe one stre­
nuously. A slam or slim Fellow is a 
skragged, tall, rawboned Fellow, the 
length of whose Arms gives him the 
advantage of strinking hard, and there­
fore such are noted for fisty-cuffs; whence 
slam seems to be derived.

Snurles,  Nostrils.

Sower-milk,  Butter-milk. Sower from 
its long standing.

A Swang,  locus paludosus, or part of 
a Pasture overflow'd with water, not 
much unlike a Tarn or Lough, whence 
the Grass by the superfluity of an olea­
ginous moisture degenerates into course 
Piles, which in Summer (most of the 
water being exhal'd) is so interwoven 
with thick mud and slime, and the Piles 
so long and top-heavy, that they embrace 
the surface of the Mud, and compose






a verdure like that of a Meadow.

Swine greun,  a Swines snout, a Dan. 
and Island. Graun Nasus, superius la­
brum. Whence our English word to grin, 
because in grinning the Muscles of the 
upper Lip are contracted.

Tabs,  Childrens hanging sleeves, a 
Tab for a Shooe Latchet is already entred.

Thin-drink,  small Beer, Cerevisia tenu­
is, whence thin is derived. The Low 
Dutch use thick Beer for strong Beer; though 
to say the truth, that they call thick Beer is 
properly so, very thick and muddy.

Wad,  Black lead, Cumberland. See 
Mr. Nicolsons Catalogue.

Walsh or Welsh,  strange, insipid, ab AS. 
Wealh, vel potiùs Teutonico Welsch 
strange: Welsh Potage, strange, insipid 
Potage.

Unleed or Unlead,  a general name for 
any crawling venomous creature; as a 
Toad, &c. It's sometimes ascribed to 
Man, and then it denotes a sly wicked 
fellow, that in a manner creeps to do 
mischief, the very pest of Society. See

AN 
Account of some Errors and Defects 
in our English Alphabet, Ortho­
graphy, and Manner of Spelling.


Having lately had occasion to 
consider our English Alphabet, 
Orthography, and manner of 
Spelling, I observed therein many Er­
rors and Omissions. Those that concern 
the Alphabet I find noted and rectified 
by the right Reverend Father in God, 
and my honored Friend John, late Lord 
Bishop of Chester in his Book intituled, 
An Essay toward an universal Character, 
&c. p. 3. c. 10. Which, because that 
Work is not every man's hand, I shall 
together with my own Observations and 
Animadversions upon our Orthography, 
and manner of Spelling, here exhibit to 
the Reader. I could wish they were cor­
rected, as giving offence to strangers, and






causing trouble and confusion both to the 
Teachers and Learners to read; but I see 
little reason to hope they ever will be, so 
great is the force of general and inve­
terate use and practice.

 I know what is pleaded in defence of 
our present Orthography, viz. that in 
this manner of Writing, the Etymologies 
and Derivations of Words appear, which 
if we should write according as we pro­
nounce, would not so easily be discerned. 
To which I answer, That the Learned 
would easily observe them notwithstand­
ing, and as for the vulgar and illiterate it 
is all one to them, they can take no no­
tice of such things.

First then as to our English Alphabet, I 
have observed it to be faulty. I. In the 
Number. 2. In the Power and Valor of 
the Letters.

As to the number of Letters it is pec­
cant both in the defect, and in the excess. 
That is to say, It wants some Letters 
that are are necessary, and contains some 
that are superfluous.

I. It wants some that are necessary, 
both Vowels and Consonants.

First, Vowels, and of those it wants 
three.






1. It wants a Letter to express the  
sound we give to a in the words Hall 
shall, wall, and the like; and to o in the 
words God, Rod, Horn, and innumerable 
the like, it being the same sound with the 
former. This is supposed to be the power 
or sound which the ancient Greeks gave 
to the Letter Alpha or α; and therefore the 
Bishop of Chester would have the Cha­
racter α used to signifie this Vowel.

2. It wants a Letter to signifie the sound 
we give to oo or double o, as in good, stood, 
look, loose, and in whatever other words 
it is used. For that this is a simple Vowel 
is manifest, in that the entire sound of it 
may be continued as long as you please; 
which is the only certain Note of Distin­
ction between a simple Vowel and a 
Diphthong. This the Bishop of Chester 
expresses by the Character Ȣ, which is u­
sed in Greek for ου Diphthong, as also the 
French ou is pronounced in the sound of 
this simple Vowel.

3. It wants a Letter to denote the 
sound we give to the Vowel u in us, um, 
&c. which is manifestly different from 
what we attribute to it in the words use, 
muse, fume, &c. This Vowel, as the Bi­
shop well observes, is wholly guttural






and comes near to the sound we make in 
groaning, As for the Letter u in use, 
muse. &c. my Lord of Chester would have 
it to be a Diphthong, and the Vowel 
which terminates the Diphthong, or the 
Subjunctive Vowel to be oo, wherein I 
cannot agree with him, the Subjunctive 
Vowel seeming to me rather to be the 
French or whistling u, there seeming to 
me to be a manifest difference between 
Luke and Look, Luce and Loose, and that 
there is nothing of the sound of the latter 
in the former.

Secondly, it wants Consonants, and 
of those four.

1. A Letter to express the sound we 
give to V Consonant, which is nothing 
else but B aspirated or incrassated or Bh. 
For tho we distinguish v Consonant from 
u Vowel, and attribute to it the power 
of B incrassated, yet do we not make it 
a distinct Letter as we ought to do. The 
power of this Letter was first expressed 
among the Latines by the Digamma Æo­
licum (so stiled for its Figure, not its 
sound) which is now the Character for 
the Letter F, but had at first the power 
of the Consonant V, and was written in 
Claudius his time invertedly, as DIFAI, 
AMPLIAFIT. Bishop Chester.






2. A Character to express D aspirated 
or incrassated, or Dh. For that this is a 
distinct Letter from Th, tho we confound
them, making Th serve for both, is ma­
nifest by these Examples.

Dh.

The, this, there, then, that, thou, 
thine, those, tho, &c.

Father, Mother, Brother, &c.

Smooth, seeth, wreath, bequeath.

Th.

Thank, Thesis, thick, thin, thistle, 
thrive, thrust.

Death, doth, both, broth, wrath, &c.

Of this Difference our Saxon Ance­
stors were aware, and therefore made pro­
vision for both in their Alphabet. Dh they 
represented by ð, as in Faðer, Moðer, 
&c. Tb by þ, as in þeif, þick, &c.

3. A Letter to denote T incrassated, or 
the Greek ϴ, which we express by Th. 
That these three last mentioned are sim­
ple Letters, and therefore ought to be 
provided for in the Alphabet by distinct 
Characters appears in that the sound of 
them (for they are sonorous) may be






continued. 2. By the Confession of the 
Composers of our Alphabet; for they 
make F a simple Letter, and give it a 
several Character, which differs no more 
from Ph, than V doth from Bh, ð from 
Dh, or þ from Th. 3. By the consent 
of the Composers of other Alphabets. 
The Greeks and Hebrews making Th a 
simple Letter, and giving it a Character, 
and the Saxons both Dh and Th.

5. A Character to express Sh, which is 
the same with the Hebrew Schin, and may 
be proved to be a simple Letter by the 
foregoing Reasons.

II. Our English Alphabet contains some 
Letters that are superfluous: five in num­
ber.

1. C, which if we use it in its proper 
power (as we ought to do) differs not 
at all from K, and therefore the one or 
the other must needs be superfluous.

2. Q, which is by general consent 
granted and agreed to be nothing else but 
Cu. And therefore many Writers, and 
among the rest no less a Critick than 
Mr. Gataker omits the u after it, as be­
ing involved in it, writing instead of 
quis, quid, quam, &c. qis, qid, qam. But 
the Bishop of Chester, who more nicely 
and curiously considered it, finds the Let­






ter involved in Q to be oo not u, to whom 
I do fully assent.

3. W, which is nothing else but the 
Letter oo rapidly pronounced. This the 
Greeks were sensible of, for instead of 
the Dutch Word Wandals, they wrote 
΄Ουάνδαλοι· and we noted before that the 
Greeks pronounced their Diphthong Ȣ 
as we do oo.

4. X is confessedly nothing but the 
Letters CS, and therefore tho it may be 
retained as a Compendium of Writing, yet is 
it by no means to be accounted a distinct 
Letter, or allowed any place in the Al­
phabet.

Y, Tho it be by some esteemed a Con­
sonant, when placed before a Vowel, yet 
is it not so, but only the Greek Iota, or 
our ee rapidly pronounced, as we said 
before of W. When it is accounted a 
Vowel as in my, thy, it differs not at all 
from what we call i long in mine, thine.

Now I come to shew that our Alpha­
bet is faulty as to the powers or valors at­
tributed to some Letters.

1. To C before e and i we give the 
power of s, before the rest of the Vowels 
of K, which is a great offence and 
stumbling block to Children, who are apt 
(as they have good reason) to pronounce






it alike before all Letters. So my own 
Children have, I remember, in the word 
accept, for example, pronounced the se­
cond c as if it had been a k, as if the 
word had been written akkept, and I was 
forced to grant them, that they were in
the right, but only they must follow 
the received Pronunciation.

2. To g before e and i we give the 
same power we do to J Consonant, that 
is Dzy, as I shall shew afterward, as in 
Gender, Ginger, Gibbet, and which is 
worse, that not constantly neither, for 
in geld, gild, gird, &c. we pronounce it as 
we do before the rest of the Vowels, 
which doth and must needs breed trouble 
and confusion to Children.

3. To that we call J Consonant we at­
tribute a strange power, which no Child 
can imagine to belong to it: which the 
Bishop of Chester hath rightly determined 
to be Dzy. That D is an ingredient into it 
Children do easily discern; for bid a 
young Child, that begins to speak, say 
John, it will say Don.

4. To the Vowel I we give two powers; 
where it is pronounced short, that of Iota 
or ee, as in thin, thick, fill, and innu­
merable others: but elsewhere of a 
Diphthong, as in thine, mine, and in the






last syllable of all other words to which e 
is added after the Consonant. It is the 
received opinion that e is there a Note of 
Production, signifying that the Letter i is 
there to be pronounced long: but I say it signi­
fies that the Character i is there to be 
pronounced as a Diphthong. That it is 
a Diphthong is clear, because in pro­
nouncing of it you cannot continue the 
entire sound, but must needs terminate 
in iota or ee. What is the prepositive 
Letter in this Diphthong is doubtful; 
one that did not curiously observe it, 
would think it to be e, but the Bishop 
of Chester will have it to be u as pro­
nounced in us. Children take notice of 
this difference between i when pronoun­
ced as a Diphthong, and when as iota. 
One of my Children in all words wherein 
it is to be pronounced as a Diphthong, pro­
nounced it as simple iota or ee. As for 
mine, thine, like, bile, it pronounced 
meen, theen, leek, beel, and so in all o­
thers of that nature; the Child, it should 
seem, finding it more facil to pronounce 
the single Vowel, not being able to frame 
its mouth to pronounce the Diphthong.

5. To the Vowel A we give two 
powers. 1. That of the Greek Alpha in 
Hall, Wall, &c. as we noted before.






2. That of the Latine A in Hat, that, 
man, bran, &c.

6. To the Vowel O we give three 
powers: 1. That of the Greek Alpha in 
God, rod, hot, &c. 2. That of the Let­
ter oo in Hood, stood, book, &c. 3. The 
power usually attributed to it in other 
Languages, as in Hole, home, stone, &c.

7. To the Vowel u we also give two 
powers, as appears in us and use. Where­
of the first is a simple Letter, but the se­
cond a Diphthong, as was noted before.

8. To ch we give a strange power or 
sound, which the Bishop of Chester right­
ly determines to be Tsh. This young 
Children perceive: for bid them pro­
nounce Church, some shall pronounce it 
Tursh, and some Shursh, the former ob­
serving the Letter T in it, and the latter 
the Letter Sh. Whence it appears that 
the true Writing of it is Tshurtsh.

9. In all words where w is put before 
h, as in what, which, when, &c. it is 
evident by the pronunciation, that the 
h ought to be put before the w; and the 
words written Hwen or Hooen, hooitsh, 
hooat, &c. So our Saxon Ancestors were 
wont to place it. Which manner of Wri­
ting I cannot but wonder how it came 
to be changed for the worse.






If all these Faults were amended, viz. 
the superfluous Letters cut off, the want­
ing supplied, and to every Letter his pro­
per power attributed, spelling would be 
much more regular, uniform and easie.

I come now to make some further Ani­
madversions upon our Orthography and 
manner of Spelling.

The Grammarians have a Rule, that 
in spelling and dividing words by Syllables 
where-ever the is a Consonant or two 
before a Vowel, the Syllable must be be­
gun with the Consonant. Against this 
Rule I would put in two Exceptions.

1. In compound words I would have 
the Preposition in Spelling, and dividing 
the Syllables, to be separated from the 
radical word. As for example, I would 
have spelled Ab-use, not A-buse; Ab-rogate, 
not A-brogate; Dis-turb, not Di-sturb; 
Dis-trust, not Di-strust, and the like.

2. In words formed from Verbs for 
Tenses, Persons, or Participles, by a sylla­
bical Adjection, I think it proper, that 
the Syllable that is added, should, in 
spelling and dividing the word be sepa­
rated from the radical verb. For exam­
ple, I would have it spelled lov-ed, not 
lo-ved; hat-ed, not ha-ted, &c. This I 
think most rational and convenient.






1. To distinguish these Adjections from 
the radical Verb. 2. Because we separate 
them thus in pronunciation, as appears 
most evidently in words that end in Li­
quids, and therefore in such we double 
the Liquid rather than so divide the word. 
As for example, rather than spell and 
divide the word swimmeth thus swi-meth 
in our Orthography we double the m,
writing swim-meth; the like might be 
said of trimmeth, drummeth, in which last 
there is no more reason the m should be 
doubled than in the word cometh. This, 
I confess, seems not so convenient in 
words that end in a Mute and Liquid, 
such as are handle, tremble, spittle; yet 
may the Analogy be well enough observed 
even in them.

3. I disapprove the adding the Letter 
e to the ends of words to signifie the 
production of the last Syllable, as to mate 
to distinguish it from mat, smoke from 
smock, mine from min, shine from shin, &c. 
This is a great offence to Strangers and 
Children, who in such words are apt 
(as they have good reason) to make two 
Syllables of one, and to spell and pro­
nounce ma-te, smo-ke, thi-ne, people. The 
production of a Syllable ought to be 
signified by Mark over the Vowel to be






produced thus, e, q, &c. But where e is 
added to a Syllable compounded with 
i it signifies not as is vulgarly thought, 
that i is to be produced, but that it stands 
for a Diphthong; as we have before 
noted. The same is to be spoken against 
the adding of a to signifie the pronouncing 
of a Vowel, as in great, beat, stroak, 
broad, beat; which, as we said just now, 
ought to be signified by a stroak over 
the Vowel to be produced, thus br&#014D;d, 
grqt, bqd, bqt, &c.

In Adjectives that end in a Mute and 
a Liquid, v. g. ble. tle. &c. I think it 
were convenient that the e were left out, 
which troubles Children and Strangers in 
spelling and reading our Language, they 
in such words making two Syllables of 
one; for example, reading instead of 
probable, pro-ba-ble, pronouncing ble as we 
do in ble-mish. I say two Syllables of 
one, for probable I make consist but of two
Syllables thus pro-babl, brittl but of one, 
con-tem-ptibl but of there. A Mute and 
Liquid joyn'd together without a Vowel 
having an imperfect sound. So we see 
they who write words of the Mexican 
Language ending in tl, of which they 
having many, put no e after the l, as Me­
caxochitl, Achiotl, &c.






5. Nouns that end in tion are a great 
stumbling block to Children, who (as they 
ought) give the same power to t in 
these as they do in other words, that is, 
its proper power, as in tied; and there­
fore all these words ought to be written 
with si, as they are pronounced, and as 
School-masters are forced to teach their 
Scholars to pronounce ti in them.

6. We write gracious, righteous, grie­
vous, and a multitude of like words with 
the Diphthong ou, but pronounce them as 
if they were written with a single u, gra­
cius, righteus, grievus: We never pro­
nounce ous in these words as we do in 
house, mouse, &c. The like may be said 
of our in honour, oratour, auditour, credi­
tour, &c.

7. In the words neck, sick, sack, lock, 
muck, and all which we write with ck, 
either the c or the k is  altogether super­
fluous: for in pronouncing I challenge 
any man to shew me a difference between 
neck and nec, sick and sic, &c.

8. The spelling of blood, flood, &c. is 
erroneous; they ought to be written 
blud, flud, &c. for we never pronounce 
these words as we do mood, neither as we 
do proud.






I might also find fault with the spell­
ing of friend, fiend, believe, grieve, and 
others of like nature, which I think were 
better written with a single i short or 
long.

I might also note many false spellings 
in particular words, as tongue for tung, 
she for shee, scituàte for situate, which is 
but lately come up, and hath no ap­
pearance of reason, the Latine Word be­
ing situs without any c. Scent for Sent, 
signifying a smell or savour, which Wri­
ting is also but lately introduced, and 
hath no more ground than the former, 
the Latin Word from whence it comes 
being sentio.

Lastly, I would have gh quite cashier­
ed, we not knowing what sound our 
Ancestors gave it. Sometimes we pro­
nounce it as a double F, as in laugh, 
trough, cough, and therefore in such 
words F ought to be substituted instead 
of it: in others only as an h or simple 
aspiration, as in through, which there­
fore may be written throuh. In others 
as right, might, bright, light, (as we now 
pronounce them) it is altogether super­
fluous, and may be omitted; for who in






pronouncing doth, or in hearing pro­
nounced can distinguish between right 
and a rite for a Custom or Ceremony; 
and might and a mite in a Cheese, so in 
plough, for which therefore plow is now 
accepted.






POSTSCRIPT.

I Have this day sent you by the Car­
rier my Collection of Local Words, 
augmented almost by the one half, 
wherein I have inserted out of the Cata­
logue you were pleased to send me, 1. All 
suck as I took not to be of general use. 
For I intend not this Book to be a general 
English Glossary; (of which sort there are 
many already extant,) but only, as the 
Title imports, a Catalogue of such as 
are proper to some Countries and not 
universally known or used.

2. I have omitted also such as are names 
of some Utensils or Instruments, or 
Terms belonging to particular Trades 
and Arts.

And 3. Words newly Coined about 
London, which will soon be diffused all 
England over.

Of the first sort are Bonny, Sedge, 
whereof you may remember they have 
Faggots  at Cambridge, using it for the 
kindling of Coal-fires. Muck, Marry,






Cricket, Soss, Bang. A Toper and 
Toping, Buck and Bucking, a Wag, 
Blend, Blink, Brickle , which I take to 
come from break, signifying any thing 
apt to break. Sod  is also used for Turf 
in most places where I have been, so is 
Wood  a known word for mad, and is in 
the usual metrical Translation of the 
Psalms.


Some Observations made and communi­
cated by Mr. Francis Brokesby, 
concerning the Dialect, and various 
Pronunciation of Words in the East 
Riding of Yorkshire.


1. Many words are varied by chang­
ing o into a: though I question 
whether our Yorkshire Pronunciation be 
not the most ancient. So for both we 
Pronounce bath: for bone, bane; for work, 
wark; hence Newark, Southwark, &c. 
for more, mare; as mickle mare, much 
more; for home, hame; hence all the 
Towns ending in ham, as Wickham, Ful­
ham, Stretham, &c. hamely for homely; 
for worse, warse and war; for stone, stane






unde Stanton; q. Stony Town, Stanford, 
Stanemore, &c. So for Wo is me, Wa's 
me Οϊμοι. So Barns Children is Borns, de­
rived from Bear; exactly answering to 
the Latin nati. For Knapweed, Knop­
weed, because of the knops at the top.

2. In many words we leave out the 
aspirate, both at the beginning, and at 
the latter end. So for Chaffe, they say 
Caffe; for Churn, Kern; and thence Kern­
milk,  is Butter-milk; for Chest, Kist; 
near the Latin Cista: for Lath, Lat; for 
Bench, Binck: for Pitch, Pick; for Thatch, 
Thack; Thatcher, Theaker; for Church, 
Kyrk; near Κυριαϰόν.

3. In many words we change ol and 
oul into au; as for cold the say caud; 
for old, aud; thence Audley, as much as 
to say Old Town; for Elder, Auder; 
or as we write Alder; thence Alderman,  
a Senator; for Wolds or Woulds,  Wauds; 
thus the ridge of Hills in the East, and 
part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, 
[our Apennine] is called: and sometimes 
the Country adjoyning is called the 
Wauds. But that which lies under the 
Hills, especially down by Humber and 
Ouse side, towards Howden, is called by






the Country-people the Lowths,  i.e. The 
low Country in contradistinction to the 
Wauds. Though some call the East-­
Riding besides Holderness, and in distincti­
on from it the Woulds.

4. In some words for oo we Pronounce 
eu, as ceul, Feul, eneuf; for cool, Fool, 
enough. In some words instead of oo, or 
o, or oa, we Pronounce ee, as, Deer, for 
Door, steck the Deer; Fleer for Floor; 
abreed for abroad; ge for go; se for so; 
se throng i.e. so full of business; ne for no. 
For Poison the Pronounce Peuson.

Note, In some part of the West Riding 
they pronounce oi, for o; hoil, for hole; 
coil, for cole; hoise and shoin, for Hose 
and Shooes.

5. They ordinarily omit s at the end 
of a word when used for his: as instead 
of Jacksons Wife, they say Jackson Wife; 
instead of Brothers Coat, Brother Coat.

6. They Place y before some words be­
ginning with Vowels; yane, yance; as in 
some other parts of England yarely for 
early; Yowes, for Ewes.






7. To the ends of some words they add 
en; as in Maslingen, Docken, Bracken: 
elsewhere in England the termination en is 
a Note of the plural number, as in Housen, 
for Houses; Hosen, for Hoses; Shooen or 
Shoon, for Shooes; Peasen, for Pease; 
Children, for Childs, &c.

In the same Country for Straw, they 
use Strea, and for Claws, Cleas.










AN
Account of preparing
some of our English
METALS and MI­
NERALS.

The Smelting and Refining of Silver, at
the Silver Mills in Cardiganshire.


THE Oar beaten into small pieces
is brought from the Mine to the
Smelting-House, and there melt­
ed with black and white Coal; i.e. with
Charcoal and Wood slit into small pieces
and dried in a Kiln, for that purpose.
The reason why they mix black and
white Coal is, because the black alone
makes too vehement a Fire, and the
white too gentle, but mixt together they
make a just temper of heat. After the
Fire is made, the Mine is cast on the
Coals; and so interchangeably Mine and






Coals. The Mine when melted runs
down into the Sump,  i.e. a round Pit of
Stone covered over with Clay within.
Thence it is laded out and cast into long
square Bars with smaller ends fit to lift
and carry them by.

These Bars they bring to the Refining
Furnace, which is covered with a thick
Cap of Stone bound about with Iron and
moveable, that so they may lift it up, and
make the test at the bottom anew (which
they do every refining.) In the middle of
the Cap there is a hole in which the Bar
of Metal hangs in Iron Slings above the
Furnace, that so it may be let down by
degrees as it melts off. Besides this they
have another hole in the side of the Fur­
nace parallel to the Horizon, and bot­
tomed with Iron. At this hole they
thrust in another Bar. The Test is of
an Oval Figure, and occupies all the
bottom of the Furnace. The Fire is put
in by the side of the Bellows. When the
Furnace is come to a true temper of heat,
the Lead converted into Litharge is cast
off by the blowing of the Bellows, the
Silver subsiding into the bottom of the
Test. The blast blows the Lead con­
verted into Litharge off the Silver after the
manner that Cream is blown with Milk.






As soon as all the glut of Litharge (for
so they call it)  is cast off, the Silver in
the bottom of the Cuple grows cold, and
the same degree of heat will not keep it
melted as before. The Cake of Silver af­
ter it grows cold springs or rises up into
Branches.

The Test is made of Marrow-Bones
burnt to small pieces, afterward stamped
to powder, and with water tempered into
a Past. The Test is about a foot thick
laid in Iron. After the Cake of Silver is
taken out, that part of the Test which
is discoloured they mingle with the Oar
to be melted; the rest they stamp and
use again for Test.

The Litharge is brought to a reducing
Furnace, and there with Charcoal only
melted into Lead. The Litharge is cast
upon the Charcoal in the Bing of the
Furnace, and as the Charcoal burns away
and the Litharge melts, more Char­
coal thrown on and Litharge put upon it
as at first smelting.

Another Furnace they have, which
they call an Almond Furnace,  in which
they melt the slags or refuse of the Li­
tharge (not stamped) with Charcoal only.

The slags or cinders of the first smelt­
ing they beat small with great stamps






lifted up by a Wheel moved with water,
and falling by their own weight. First
they are stamped with dry Stamps, then
sifted with an Iron Sieve in water. That
which lies at the bottom of the Sieve is
returned to the smelting Furnace with­
out more ado. That which swims over
the Sieve is beaten with wet Stamp.

That which passeth through the Sieve,
as also that which after it hath been beaten
with the wet Stamps passes through a fine
Grate or Strainer of Iron, goeth to the
Buddle,  which is a Vessel made like to a 
shallow Tumbrel, standing a little shel­
ving. 

Thereon the Matter is laid, and water
running constantly over it, moved to
and fro with an Iron Rake or How, and
so the water carries away the Earth and
Dross, the Metal remaining behind. That
which is thus Budled they lue with a thick
hair Sieve close wrought in a Tub of wa­
ter, rolling the Sieve about, and enclining
it this way and that way with their hands.
The light which swims over to the Sieve is
returned again to the Buddle. That
which subsides is fit for the smelting
Furnace.

They have besides an Assay Furnace, 
wherewith they try the value of the Me­






tal, i.e. what proportion the Lead bears
to the Silver, cutting a piece off every
Bar and melting it in a small Cupel.Antedates earliest OED citation (1707). First
they weigh the piece cut off, then after
the Lead is separated the Silver. A Tun
of Metal will yield 10, sometimes 15,
and if it be rich 20 l. weight of Silver.
All Lead Oar dig'd in England hath a
proportion of Silver mixt with it, but
some so little, that it will not quit cost to
Refine it. 

At the first smelting they mingle se­
veral sorts of Oar, some richer, some
poorer, else they will not melt so kindly. 

The Silver made here is exceedingly fine
and good.

These six Mountains in Cardiganshire,
not far distant from each other, afford
Silver Oar, Talabont, Geginnon, Comsom­
lack, Gedarren, Bromefloid and Cummer.

At our being there they dig'd only at
Talabont.

They sink a Perpendicular square hole
or shaft, the sides whereof they strengthen
round from top to bottom with Wood,
that the Earth fall not in.

The transverse pieces of Wood, they
call stemples, and upon these catching
hold with their Hands and Feet they
descend without using any Rope. They






dig the Oar thus, one holds a little picque
or punch of Iron, having a long handle
of Wood, which they call a Gad;  ano­
ther with a great Iron Hammer or Sledge
drives it into the Vein.

The Vein of Metal runs East and West,
it riseth North, and slopes or dips to the
South. There is a white Fluor about the
Vein, which they call Spar, and a black
which they call blinds. This last covers
the Vein of Oar, and when it appears
they are sure to find Oar.

They sell the Oar for 3 l. or 4 l. the 
Tun, more or less, as it is in goodness, or 
as it is more rare or plentiful.

This Information and ac­
count we had from Major Hill,
1662. Who was then Master of
the Silver Mills.

The History of these Silver-Works may
be seen in Dr. Fullers Worthies of Wales.
General, p. 3.

The smelting of Lead is the same with
the smelting of Silver Oar, and therefore
no need that any thing be said of it.









The preparing and smelting, or blow­
ing of Tin in Cornwal.


THE Tinners find the Mine by the
Shoad  (or as they call it Squad)
which is loose Stones of Tin mixed with
the Earth, of which they give you this
account.

The load or Vein of Tin before the
flood came up to the Superficies of the
Earth. The flood washing the upper
part of it as of the whole Earth, brake
it off from the load, and confounded or
mixed it with the Earth to such a depth.
They observe that the deeper the shoad 
lies, the nearer is the main load, and the
shallower, the further off. Sometimes it
comes up to the exterior Superficies of
the Earth. The main load begins at
the East, and runs Westwar, shelving
still deeper and deeper; and sometimes
descending almost perpendicularly. Be­
sides the main load, they have little
branches that run from it North and
South, and to other points which they
call Countrey. The Vein or load is some­






times less, sometimes greater, sometimes
not a Foot thick, sometimes three Foot or
more. When they have digged a good
way they sink an Air-shaft, else they can­
not breath or keep their Candles light.
The shoad commonly descends a Hill side.
There is a kind of fluor  which they call
Spar next the Vein, and which sometimes
encompasseth it. In this are often found 
the Cornish Diamonds. Above the Spar
lies another kind of substance like a white
soft Stone, which they call Kellus.  They
get out the Mine with a Pick-Ax, but
when it is hard they use a Gad  [a Tool
like a Smiths Punch] which they drive in
with one end of their Pick Ax made like
a Hammer. When they have gotten out
of the Mine, they break it with a Ham­
mer into small pieces, the biggest not ex­
ceeding half a pound or a pound, and
then bring it to the stamps. [The stamps
are only two at one place, lifted up by a 
Wheel moved with water as the Silver
Mills]. There it is put into a square open
Box into which a spout of water con­
tinually runs, and therein the stamps
beat it to powder. One side of the Box
mentioned is made of an Iron-plate per­
forated with small holes like a Grate, by
which the water runs out, and carries 






away with it the Mine that is pounded
small enough the pass the holes, dross and
all together, in a long Gutter or Trough
made of Wood. The dross and earth
(as being lighter) is carried all along the
Trough to a Pit or Vessel into which the
Trough delivers it, called a loob:  the
Tin as being heavier, subsides and stays
behind in the Trough: and besides at a 
good distance from the stamps they put a
Turf in the Trough to stop the Tin that
it run not further.

The Tin remaining in the Trough
they take out and carry to the buddle, [a
Vessel described in the Silver Work]
where the Sand and Earth is washed from
it by the water running over it, the Tin­
ners stirring and working it both with a
Shovel, and with their Feet. In the bud­
dle the rough Tin (as they call it) falls
behind; the head Tin lies uppermost or
foremost. The head Tin passes to the
wreck, where they work it with a wooden
Rake in Vessels almost like the buddling
Vessels, water running also over it. In 
the wreck the head Tin lies again fore­
most, and that is finished and fit for the
blowing House, and is called black Tin, 
being black of colour, and as fine as Sand.
The rough Tin lies next, that as also that






in the buddle they sift to separate the
coarse, and dross, and stones from it,
which is returned to the stamps to be
new beaten. The fine is lewed in a fine 
fierce moved and waved to and fro in
the Water, as is described in the Silver
Work; the Oar subsiding to the bottom,
the Sand, Earth, and other dross, flows
over the Rim of the sierce with the Wa­
ter: that which remains in the sierce
they sift through a fine Sieve, and
what passes through they call black 
Tin. In like manner they order the wast
Tin that falls hindmost in the buddle and
wreck, which they call the Tail,  as also
that which falls into the loob, Pit or
Sump, viz. washing and sifting of it,
which they call stripping of it, returning
the rough and coarse to the stamps, and
the finer to the wreck.

With the rough Tin that is returned 
to th estmaps they mingle new Oar,
else it will not work, but fur up the 
stamps. The Tin in the loob they let
lie a while, and the longer the better,
for, say they, it grows and increases by
lying.






The black Tin is smelted at the
blowing House with Charcoal only, 
first throwing on Charcoal, then upon
that black Tin, and so interchangeably
into a very deep Bing  (which they 
call the House) broader at the top and
narrower at the bottom. They make
the Fire very vehement, blowing the
Coals continually with a pair of great
Bellows moved by Water, as in the
smelting of other Metals. The Melt­
ing Tin, together with the dross or slag
runs out at a hole at the bottom of
the Bing into a large Trough made of
Stone. The Cinder or slag swims on 
the top of it like scum, and hardens pre­
sently.

This they take off with a Shovel and
lay it by.

When they have got a sufficient
heap of it they sell it to be stamped,
budled and lued. They get a good
quantity of Tin out of it. Formerly
it was thrown away to mend High
Ways, as nothing worth. When they
have a sufficient quantity of the melted
Metal they cast it into Oblong square
pieces in a mould made of Moore-stone. 
The lesser pieces they call slabs, the 
greater Blocks. Two pound of black






Tin ordinarily yields a pound of white
or more.

The Tin after it is melted is coyned; 
i.e. marked by the Kings Officer with
the Lion Rampant. The Kings Custom
is four Shillings on every hundred pound
weight. Other particulars concerning
the Tin-Works I omit, because they
may be seen in Carewy's survey of Corn­
wal. But the manner of preparing the
Tin for blowing or smelting is now
much different from what it was in his
time.

Tin-Oar is so different in colour and
appearance from Tin, that one would
wonder that the one should come out 
of the other: and somewhat strange it
is that Tin being so like to Lead, Tin­
Oar should be so unlike to Lead-Oar,
being very like to the Lead that is melted
out of it.







The manner of the Iron-Work at
the Furnace.


THE Iron-Mine lies sometimes
deeper, sometimes shallower in the
Earth from four to forty, and up­
ward.

There are several sorts of Mine, some
hard, some gentle, some rich, some
coarser. The Iron-Masters always mix
different sorts of Mine together, other­
wise they will not melt to advantage.

When the Mine is brought in, they
take Small-Coal and lay a row of Small­
Coal, and upon it a row of Mine,
and so alternately, S. S. S. one above
another, and setting the Coals on fire,
therewith burn the Mine.

The use of this burning is to molli­
fie it, that so it may be broke in small
pieces: otherwise if it should be put in­
to the Furnace as it comes out of the
Earth, it would not melt but come away
whole.

Care also must be taken that it be not
too much burned, for then it will loop, 






i.e. melt and run together in a mass.
After it is burnt, they beat it into small
pieces with an Iron Sledge, and then
put it into the Furnace (which is before
charged with Coals) casting it upon the
top of the Coals, where it melts and falls
into the Hearth in the space of about 
twelve hours more or less, and then it is
run into a Sow.

The Hearth or bottom of the Fur­
nace is made of a Sand-stone, and the
sides round to the height of a Yard or
thereabout, the rest of the Furnace is
lined up to the top with Brick.

When they begin upon a new Furnace;
they put fire for a day or two before they
begin to blow.

Then they blow gently and increase
by degrees till they come to the height in
ten weeks or more.

Every six days they call a Founday,  in 
which space they make eight Tun of
Iron, if you divide the whole summ of
Iron made by the Foundays: for at first
they make less in a Founday, at last 
more.

The Hearth, by the force of the Fire,
continually blown, grows wider and
wider, so that if at first it contains so
much as it will make a Sow of six hundred






or seven hundred pound weight, at last
it will contain so much as will make
a Sow of two thousand pound. The
lesser pieces, of one thousand pound, or
under, they call Pigs. 

Of twenty four Loads of Coals they
expect eight Tun of Sows: to every
Load of Coals, which consists of eleven
Quarters, they put a Load of Mine,
which contains eighteen Bushels.

A Hearth ordinarily, if made of good
Stone, will last forty Foundays, that is
forty Weeks, during which time the
Fire is never let go out. They ne­
ver blow twice upon one Hearth,
though they go upon it not above five or
six Foundays.

The cinder like scum swims upon
the melted Metal in the Hearth, and
is let out once or twice before a Sow
is cast. 







The manner of working the Iron at
the Forge or Hammer.


IN every Forge or Hammer there are
two Fires at least, the one they call 
the Finery, the other the Chafery. 

At the Finery by the working of the
Hammer they bring it into Blooms and
Anconies, thus.

The sow at first they roll into the Fire,
and melt off a piece of about three
fourths of a hundred weight, which, so
soon as it is broken off, is called a Loop.

This Loop they take out with their
shingling Tongs, and beat it with Iron
Sledges upon an Iron Plate near the Fire,
that so it may not fall in pieces but be in
a capacity to be carried under the Ham­
mer. Under which they then remove
it, and drawing a little water, beat it
with the Hammer very gently, which
forces cinder and dross out of the Mat­
ter, afterwards by degrees drawing more
water they beat it thicker and stronger
till they bring it to a Bloom, which is a 
four-square mass of about two Foot long.






This operation they call shingling the
Loop.

This done they immediately return it 
to the Finery again, and after two or
three heats and working they bring it to
an Ancony, the figure whereof is in the
middle, a Bar about three feet long of
that shape they intend the whole Bar
to be made of it: at both ends a square
piece left rough to be wrought at the
Chafery.

Note, At the Finery three load of the
biggest Coals go to make one Tun of
Iron.

At the Chafery they only draw out the
two ends sutable to what was drawn out
at the Finery in the middle, and so finish
the Bar.

Note, I. One Load of the smaller
Coals will draw out one Tun of Iron
at the Chafery.

2. They expect that one Man and
a Boy at the Finery should make two
Tuns of Iron in a Week: two Men at
the Chafery should take up, i. e. make or
work five or six Tun in a Week.

3. If into the Hearth where they work
the Iron-sows (whether the Chafery or
the Finery) you cast upon the Iron a
piece of Brass, it will hinder the Metal 






from working, causing it to spatter a­
bout, so that it cannot be brought into a
solid piece.

This account of the whole process of
the Iron-work I had form one of the
chief Iron-Masters in Sussex, my honor­
ed Friend Walter Burrel of Cuck-field
Esquire deceased. And now that I have 
had occasion to mention this worthy
Gentleman, give me leave by the by
to insert a few Observations referring
to Husbandry communicated by him in
occasional discourse on those Subjects.

1. In removing and transplanting
young Oaks you must be sure not to
cut off or wound that part of the Root,
which descends down-right (which in
some Countries they call the Tap-Root) 
but dig it up to the bottom, and prepare
your hole deep enough to set it: else if
you persuade it to live, you hinder the
growth of it half in half.

2. Corn or any other Grain, the
longer it continues in the ground, or the
earlier it is Sown, cæteris paribus, the bet­
ter laden it is, and the Berry more plump,
full and weighty, and of stronger nou­
rishment, as for example, Winter Oats
better than Summer Oats, Beans set in
February than those set in March, &c.






3. The most effectual way to prevent
smutting or burning of any Corn is to
Lime it before you Sow it, as is found
by daily experience in Sussex, where,
since this practice of Liming, they have
no burnt Corn, whereas before they had
abundance. They Lime it thus, first
they wet the Corn a little to make it stick,
and then sift or sprinkle powdered Lime
upon it.

4. He uses to Plow with his Oxen
end-ways, or all in one File, and not 
to Yoke them by pairs, whereby he
finds a double advantage. 1. He by
this means loseth no part of the strength
of any Ox, whereas breastwise, it is ve­
ry hard so evenly to match them, as
that a great part of the strength of
some of them be not rendred useless.
2. In this way a wet and clay ground
is no so much poached by the feet of the
Oxen.

5. He hath practised to burn the ends
of all the Posts which he sets into the
ground to a Coal on the outside, where­
by they continue a long time without
rotting, which otherwise would sudden­
ly decay.






This Observation I also find men­
tioned in an Extract of a Letter, writ­
then by David Von-der-beck, a German
Philosopher and Physitian at Minden,
to Dr. Langelot, &c. Registred in the
Philosophical Transactions, Number 92.
Pag. 5185. In these words, Hence al­
so they sleightly burn the ends of Tim­
ber, to be set in the ground, that so by
the fusion made by Fire, the Volatile
Salts, which by the accession of the
moisture of the Earth would easily be
consumed, to the corruption of the Tim­
ber may catch and fix one another.

6. He first introduced the use of Fern
for burning of Lime, which serves that
purpose as well as Wood, (the flame
thereofbeing very vehement) and is far
cheaper.

7. Bucks if gelded when they have
cast their Head, their Horns never grow
again, if when their Horns are grown,
they never cast them; in brief their
Horns never grow after they are gelded.

This observation, expressed in almost
the same words, I find in the Summary
of a Book of Francesco Rodi the Italian,
called, Esperienze intorno à diverse cose na­
turali, &c. Delivered in the Philosophical
Transactions, Number 92. pag. 6005.






8. Rooks, if they infest your Corn,
are more terrified if in their sight you
take a Rook and plucking it Limb from
Limb, cast the several Limbs about your
Field, than if you hang up half a dozen 
dead Rooks in it.

9. Rooks when they make their Nests,
one of the pair always sits by to watch
it, while the other goes to fetch mate­
rials to build it. Else if both go and
leave it unfinished, their Fellow-Rooks,
ere they return again will have carried
away toward their several Nests all the
sticks and materials they had got toge­
ther. Hence perhaps the word Rook­ 
ing for cheating and abusing. 





The manner of the Wire work at
Tintern in Monmouthshire.


THey take little square Bars, made
like Bars of Steel, which they call
Osborn-Iron,  wrought on purpose for this
manufacture; and strain"osborn iron(n)" not found in OED. i. e. draw them
at a Furnace with a Hammer moved by
water (like those at the Iron Forges, but
lesser) into square Rods of about the big­






ness of ones little Finger, or less, and
bow them round. When that is done
they put them into a Furnace, and neal
them with a pretty strong Fire for a­
bout twelve hours: after they are nealed
they lay them in water for a month or
two (the longer the better) then the Rip­
pers take them and draw them into Wire
through two or three holes.

Then they neal them again for six
hours or more, and water them the se­
cond time about a Week, then they are
carried to the Rippers who draw them to
a two-bond Wire, as bing as a great Pack­
thread.

Then again they are nealed the third
time, and watered about a Week as be­
fore, and delivered to the small Wire
Drawers, whom there they call Over­
house­men,  I suppose only because they
work in an upper Room.Not found in OED but in later dictionaries.

In the Mill, where the Rippers work,
the Wheel moves several Engins like lit­
tle Barrels, which they also call Barrels,
hooped with Iron. The Barrel hath two 
Hooks on the upper side, upon each
whereof hang two Links standing a-cross,
and fastned to the two ends of the Tongs,
which catch hold of the Wire and draw
it through the hole. The Axis on which






the Barrel moves, runs not through the
Center, but is placed towards one side,
viz. that on which the Hooks are. Un­
derneath is fastned to the Barrel a Spoke
of Wood, which they call a Swingle, 
which is drawn back a good way by the
Calms or Cogs in the Axis of the Wheel,
and draws back the Barrel, which falls
to again by its own weight. The Tongs,
hanging on the Hooks of the Barrel,
are by the Workmen fastned on the
Wire, and by the force of the Wheel
the Hooks being drawn back, draw the
Wire through the holes.

They anoint the Wire with Train-Oil,
to make it run the easier. The Plate,
wherein the holes are, is on the outside
Iron, on the inside Steel.

The holes are bigger on the Iron
side, because the Wire finds more re­
sistance from the Steel, and is streightned
by degrees.

There is another Mill where the small
Wire is drawn, which with one Wheel
moves three Axes that run the length of
the House on three Floors one above ano­
ther.

The Description whereof would be
tedious and difficult to understand without
a Scheme, and therefore I shall omit it.

We saw the manner of making Vi­
triol or Cooperas at Bricklesey in Es­
sex. They lay the Stones upon a 
large Bed or Floor prepared in the
open Air, underneath which there are
Gutters or Troughs disposed to receive
and carry away the Liquor impreg­
ate with the Mineral to a Cistern
where it is Reserved. [For the Air
and Weather dissolving the Stones, the
Rain falling upon them carries away
with it the Vitrioline Juice or Salt dis­
solved.]

This Liquor they boil in large
leaden Pans putting in a good quan­
tity of old Iron. When it is suffici­
ently evaporated they pour it out into 
large Troughs wherein it cools, the
Vitriol crystallizing to the sides of the
Troughs, and to cross Bars put into
them.

The Liquor that remains after the 
Vitriol is Crystallized they call the Mo­
ther, and reserve it to be again evaporated
by boyling.

They gather of these Stones in several
places besides the Coast of the Island
of Shepey. I have observed people ga­
thering them on the Sea-shore near to
Bright Helmston in Sussex.






The manner of making Vitriol in
Italy is something different from ours in
England, which take in Matthiolus his
words.

First they take Lead and waste it in an
Oven or Furnace: that is bring it
to a Substance almost like a Litharge, by
stirring it with an Iron Rake or How.
This they grind with two pair of Stones
which deliver it from one to another:
the first grind it coarser, the second finer
[There is a Mill so contrived as that it
moves at once six pair of these Stones.]
Thus reduced to powder and washed, it
is put into an Oven or reverberating Fur­
nace, and by continual stirring with the
Iron Rake or How, it is brought to the
right colour in two or three days. The
Fire must not be extreme all this while,
else it will clod together and change
colour. The Iron Rake wherewith it is
stirred is hung or poised on an Iron Hook,
else it is so heavy that it could not be
moved by one Man.

The Allom Work at Whitby in
Yorkshire.


THE process of making Allom, as
we partly saw, and partly re­
ceived from the Workmen, was as fol­
loweth.

First, They take the Mine picked from
the Desse or Rock, and laying it on great
heaps burn it with Whins and Wood till
it be white. When it is sufficiently 
burned, they barrow it into a Pit made
on purpose, some ten feet long, six foot
broad, and seven fourths of a yard deep,
where it is steeped in water for the space
of eight or ten hours. Then they draw out
the Liquor, (which is but a Lixivium im­
pregnated with the Allom-Mine) into 
Troughs by which it is conveyed to the
Allom-House, into a deep Cistern of a­
bout twenty yards circumference, and
three yards and half deep. After this
first water is drawn off the Mine in the
Pits, they do not presently cast away the
Mine, but pour fresh water on it the
second time, and after the second water






is drawn off (which is much weaker
than the first) they cast out the Mine
and put in new, and pour on fresh water
as before.

Out of the Cistern they convey the 
Lixivium by Troughs into the Pans,
where it is boiled for the space of twenty
four hours ordinarily. Then they take
off the Liquor out of the Pans, and ex­
amine it by weight, to know how much
Lee made of kelp it will require, which
is for the most part six inches of the Pans
depth.

Which being put in so soon as the Li­
quor boils, or flows up, by the putting in
of an Iron Cole-Rake, or other Iron
Instrument, they draw it off into a set­
tler, and there let it stand about an hour,
that so the Sulphur and other dregs may
settle to the bottom, which being done
it is drawn off into Coolers, where it
continues about four days and nights.
The cooler being drawn about half full,
they pour into it a quantity of Urine, viz.
about eight Gallons into a Cooler that
contains about two half Tuns.

Having thus stood four days and
nights, it is quite cool, and the Allom
Crystallized to the sides of the Cooler.
Then they scoop out the Liquor (which






they call the Mother) into a Cistern,  and
put it into the Pans again with new Lixi­
vium to be evaporated by boiling, &c. 
The Allom that is shotten and crystal­
lized on the sides of the Cooler they
scrape off and wash with fair Spring
water; then throw it into a Bing,
where the water drains from it. Thence
it is taken and cast into a Pan, which
they call the rocking Pan, and there 
melted, it is scooped out and conveyed by
Troughs into Tuns, in which it stands
about ten days until it be perfectly cool
and condensed. Then they unhoop
and stave the Tuns, and taking out the
Allom, chip it and carry it into the
Store-House.

We failed to enquire exactly what
proportion of kelp they put in. For 
though they told us six inches of the Pans
depth, yet they told us not how deep the
Pans are made.










THE
Making of Salt at Nampt­
wych in Cheshire.


THE Salt-Spring, or (as they call
it) the Brine-pit is near the Ri­
ver, and is so plentiful, that were
all the water boiled out that it would
afford (as they told us) it would yield
Salt enough for all England. The Lords
of the Pit appoint how much shall be
boiled as they see occasion, that the
Trade be not clogged.

Divers persons have interest in the
Brine-pit, so that it belongs not all to
one Lord; some have one Lead-walling,
some two, some three, some four or
more. [N.B. A Lead-walling  is the
Brine of twenty four hours boiling for one
House.]

Two hundred and sixteen Lead-wall­
ings or thereabout belong to all the






Owners of the Pit. No Tradesman,
Bachelor or Widow can Rent more than
eighteen Lead-wallings.

They have four sworn Officers chosen
yearly, which they call Occupiers of Wall­
ing, whose Duty it is to see equal dealing
between Lord and Tenant, and all per­
sons concerned. They appoint how ma­
ny Houses shall work at a time, and that
is twelve at the most. When there is oc­
casion for Salt to be made, they cause
a Cryer to make Proclamation, that so
all Parties concerned may put to their
Fires at the same time; and so when they
shall cease at a determinate hour, at
which they must give over; else they
cause their Salt to be marred by casting
dirt into it, or the like.

There are in the Town about fifty
Houses, and every House hath four Pans,
which the Rulers are to see be exactly of
the same measure.

Salt-water taken out of the Brine-pit in
two hours and a quarter boiling, will be 
evaporated and boiled up into Salt. When
the Liquor is more than luke-warm, they
take strong Ale, Bullocks Blood, and
Whites of Eggs mixed together with Brine
in this proportion; of Blood one Egg­
shell full, the White of one Egg and a






Pint of Ale, and put it into a Pan of
twenty four Gallons or thereabouts. The
Whites of the Eggs and the Blood serve
to clarifie the Brine by raising the scum,
which they take off just upon the boiling
of the Pans, otherwise it will boil in,
and spoil the Salt. The older the blood
is, the better it is, cæteris paribus.
They do not always put in blood, viz.
when there is danger of the Liquors
boiling too fast. If the Liquor happens
to boil too fast, they take to allay it
Brine that had been boil'd and drain'd
from the Salt: Crude Brine, they say,
will diminish their Salt. The Ale serves
(they said) to harden the Corn of the
Salt.

After one hour boiling, the Brine will
begin to Corn: then they take a small
quantity of clear Ale, and sprinkle there­
of into the Pan about one Egg shell
full. [Note, If you put in too much
it will make the Broth boil over the
Pan.] All the while before they put
in the last Ale they cause the Pan to
boil as fast as they can; afterwards
very gently till the Salt be almost
dry. They do not evaporate ad sicci­
tatem, but leave about a Pottle or Gal­
lon of Brine in the Pan, lest the Salt






should burn and stick to the sides of the
Pan.

The Brine thus sufficiently boiled and
evaporated, they take out the Salt, and
put it into Conical Baskets, (which they
call Barrows)  and in them let the water
drain from it an hour, more or less, and
then set it to dry in the Hot-house be­
hind the Furnace.Antedates earliest OED citation (1686).

A Barrow containing six Peck is sold
there for 1 s. 4. d.

Out of two Pans of forty eight Gal­
lons they expect seven Pecks of Salt,
Winchester-measure.

Note, The House in which the Salt is
boiled is called the Wych-house,  whence
may be guessed what Wych signifies, and
why all those Towns where there are
Salt-Springs, and Salt made, are called
by the name of Wych, viz. Namptwych,
Northwych, Middlewych, Droitwych. The
Vessel whereinto the Brine is by Troughs
conveyed from the Brine-Pit is called the
Ship.  It is raised up out of the Pit by a
Pump. Between the Furnace and the
Chimney Tunnels which convey up the
Smoak is the Hot-House where they
set their Salt to dry, along the floor
whereof run two Funnels from the
Furnaces almost parallel to the Horizon,






and then arise perpendicularly; in these
the flame and smoak running along
from the Furnaces heat the Room by the
way.

At Droitwych in Worcestershire the Salt
is boiled in shallow leaden Pans. They
first put in Salt-water out of the Brine­
Pit.

After one hours boiling they fill up the
Pan with water that drains from the Salt
set to dry in Barrows: after a second
hours boiling they fill up the Pan again
with the same.

In five hours space the Pan boils dry,
and they take out the Salt.

In twenty four hours they boil out five
Pans: and then draw out the Ashes: af­
ter the Ashes are drawn out, they put
in the White of an Egg, to cause the scum
to arise [viz. the Dust and Ash that fell
into the Pans while the Ashes were draw­
ing out] which they take off with a scum­
mer. After four hours they begin to take
out the Salt; and once in twenty four 
hours they take out a Cake which sticks
to the bottom of the Pan, (which they
call clod Salt) otherwise the Pan would
melt.  They told us that they use neither
Blood nor Ale. The Salt made here is
extraordinary white and fine.






Anno 1670. a Rock of Natural Salt,
from which issues a vigorous sharp Brine,
was discovered in Cheshire in the ground
of William Marbury, Esq; The Rock,
which is as hard and pure as Allom,
and when Pulverized, a fine and sharp
Salt; is between thirty three and thirty
four yards distant from the Surface of the
Earth. Mountains of Fossile Salt are
found in Hungary, Transilvania, Lithua­
nia, &c.





The manner of making Salt of Sea­
sand in Lancashire,


IN Summer time in dry weather they
Skim or Pare off the upper part of the
Sand in the Flats and Washes that are
covered at full Sea, and bare when the
Tide is out, and lay it up on great
heaps.

Of this Sand they take and put in
Troughs bored with holes at the bottom,
and thereon pour Water, as Laundresses
do upon Ashes to make a Lixivium,
which Water draining through the Sand,
carries the Salt therein contained down






with it into Vessels placed underneath to
receive it. So long as this Liquor is
strong enough to bear an Egg, they pour
on more Water; so soon as the Egg be­
gins to sink they cast the Sand out of the
Troughs, and put in new. 

This water thus impregnate with Salt
they boil in leaden Pans, wherein the
water evaporating, the Salt remains be­
hind.

There is also at Newcastle, Preston
Pans in Scotland, Whithaven in Cumber­
land, and elsewere great plenty of Salt
made of Sea water by boiling, and evapo­
rating in like manner, wherein they make
use of Oxes Blood.

As for these accounts of preparing
some of our English Mineral, I dare an­
swer for the half of them, having seen
them my self many years ago in my
Travels through England and Wales, and
published them Anno 1674. Since which
time other processes have been given in
the Philophical Transactions, which being
more Operose may be useful to under­
takers of such Works, therefore we will
refer to them.
