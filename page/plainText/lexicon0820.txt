To the Reader.

SVch as by their place and cal­
ling (but especially Preachers)
as haue occasion to speake pub­
likely before the ignorant peo­
ple, are to be admonished, that
they neuer affect any strange inkhorne
tearmes, but labour to speake so as is com­
monly receiued, and so as the most ignorant
may wel vnderstand them: neither seeking to
be ouer fine or curious, nor yet liuing ouer­
carelesse, vsing their speech as most men doe,
and ordering their wits as the fewest haue
done. Some men seeke so far for outlandish
English, that they forget altogether their
mothers language, so that if some of their
mothers were aliue, they were not able to
tell or vnderstand what they say; & yet these
fine English Clearkes will say they speake in
their mother tongue; but one might well
charge them for counterfayting the Kings
English. Also, some farre iournied Gentle­
men, at their returne home, like as they loue








to goe in forraine apparrell, so they will
pouder their talke with ouer-sea language.
Hee that commeth lately out of France, will
talke French English, and neuer blush at
the matter. Another chops in with English
Italinated, and applyeth the Italian phrase
to our English speaking, the which is as if
an Orator, that professeth to vtter his minde
in plaine Latine, would needes speake Poe­
trie, and farre fetched colours of strange an­
tiquitie. Doeth any wise man thinke, that
wit resteth in strange words, or else standeth
it not in wholsome matter, & apt declaring
of a mans mind? Doe we not speake, because
we would haue others to vnderstand vs? or is
not the tongue giuen for this ende, that one
might know what another meaneth? There­
fore, either we must make a difference of En­
glish, and say some is learned English, and
othersome is rude English, or the one is
Court talke, the other is Country speech, or
else wee must of necessitie banish all affected
Rhetorique, and vse altogether one manner
of language. Those therefore that will auoid
this folly, and acquaint themselues with the
plainest and best kinde of speech, must seeke
from time to time such wordes as are com­








monly receiued, & such as properly may ex­
presse in plaine manner, the whole conceit of
their minde. And looke what words we best
vnderstand, & knowe what they meane, the
same should soonest be spoken, and first ap­
plied to the vtterance of our purpose. Ther­
fore for this end, foure things would chiefly
be obserued in the choyse of wordes. First,
that such wordes as wee vse, should be pro­
per vnto the tongue wherein wee speake. A­
gaine, that they be plaine for all men to per­
ceiue. Thirdly, that they bee apt and meete.
most properly to set out the matter. Fourth­
ly, that wordes translated, from one signi­
fication to another, (called of the Grecians
Tropes,) be vsed to beautifie the sentence, as
precious stones are set in a ring to commend
the gold. Now such are thought apt wordes,
that properly agree vnto that thing, which
they signifie, and plainely expresse the nature
of the same. therefore, they that haue re­
gard of their estimation and credite, doe wa­
rily speake, and with choise, vtter words most
apt for their purpose. In waightie causes,
graue wordes are thought most needefull
that the greatnesse of the matter, may the ra­
ther appeare, in the vehemencie of their








talke. So likewise of other, like order must
be taken. Albeit some, not onely doe not
obserue this kinde of aptnesse, but also they
fall into much fondnes, by vsing wordes out
of place and applying them to diuers mat­
ters without all discretion.

If thou be desirous (gentle Reader) right­
ly and readily to vnderstand, and to profit
by the Table, and such like, then thou must
learne the Alphabet, to wit, the order of the
Letters as they stand, perfectly without
booke, and where euery Letter standeth: as
(b) neere the beginning, (n) about the mid­
dest, and (t) toward the ende. Now if the
word, which thou art desirous to finde, be­
gin with (a) then looke in the beginning of
this Table, but if with (v) looke towards the
end. Again, if thy word begin with (ca) looke
in the beginning of the Letter (c) but if with
(cu) then looke toward the end of that Let­
ter. And so of all the rest, &c.

And further vnderstand, that al such words
as are deriued and drawne from the Greeke,
are noted with this letter (g.) And the french
are marked thus (§) but such wordes as are
deriued from the Latine and others, haue no
marke at all. Farewell.
