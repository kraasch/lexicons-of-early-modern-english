¶ Here beginneth a goodly bryefe trea­
tyse of the Pestylence, with the causes, 
signes, and cures of the same: composed, 
and newly recognised by Thomas 
Phayer studious in Philosophie 
and Phisicke, to the ayde, com­
fort, and vtilitie of 
the poore.




¶ What is mente or signified by 
this woorde pestilence.


PEstylence is none o­
ther thyng but a ve­
nemous infection of 
theayer, enemye to the
vitall spirites, by a 
certayne malicyouse 
and euell propertye 
(& not of any quanti­
ty elemental) that is wythin it selfe. 

For euen as pure triacle is a comforter 
of lyfe not bicause of heat, cold, moyst­
nes or drynes, but for as moch as oute
of al his composicion there redoundeth a cer­
tayne fourme agreynge to the forme of 
the vital spirites of our body, so is the 
foresaid vapour enemy to our natures
not for any qualitie as is sayde before, 
but for that, that his proportion is directe euen 
contrarye to our vital spiritees, consisting 
in the harte, which vital spirites, yf by the 
will of God, & ordynary dyet, be stronger 
in the pacient than the foresayd vapour is
they dryue it from the bodye & wil not be



infected. And yf it happen that the forsaid
spirites be weaker thqn the venym or the 
bodye ful of humours apte to putrefa­
ction, than it doth incontinent assaute 
the lyuelye membres, and excepte re­
medye, brynge the body quycklye to de­
struction. But when we do saye the va­
poure to be venemouse, we meane not 
that it is a poyson of it selfe in deede, for 
then shulde euerye creature be indifferent­
lye infected, & none shulde escape that 
draweth it in breath, but I cal it veny­
mouse, for that it is of such a naughty 
qualitie that it may be lightlye conuer­
ted into venyme, that is to say apte to 
burnynge and corosion, as do mercury 
sublymed, quicke lyme or ratten bane, &
other suche lyke kyndes of venyms.

Thus ye maye perceyue that all the 
great daunger that is in this disease com­
meth of the noughtynesse of humours, 
which are made apte to receyue the said 
vapours, and not by violence of 
the infected ayre 
onelye.
