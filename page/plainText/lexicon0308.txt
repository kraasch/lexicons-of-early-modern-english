AMong all Sacred and Diuine Bookes,
which teach that great Mystery of godlinesse (Right Honourable) there are
none more Mysticall, then the Canticles of Salamon: The Epistle to the
Hebrewes: and the Apocalipse or Reuelation of S.
Iohn. In the first of these three, we are by a
continuall Allegorie of Mariage, instructed in the most
sweet and straight coniunction betweene Christ and his
Church. In the second, vnder comparison, with Tipes and
Figures of the Law, we do
learne the perfection of Christs Priest-hood and Sacrifice,
for full reconciliation



of all elect sinners with God. In the third (which hath as
many Mysteries, as words) by dark Propheticall Phrases, wee
haue fully deciphered the condition of the Christian Church,
till the returne of Christ her Husband; together, with the certaine ruine, both of
Turkish and Popish Regiments, as most infest enemies to the spouse and truth of God. The
explication of these portions of Sacred writ, by an easie
and familiar way of a Dictionary, I haue thought it my dutie
(humbly crauing your Lordship so to interpret it) to
dedicate vnto you (my Right Hon: good Lord, to whom for manie respects, especially for
your gracious fauour to my meane selfe, and your great
affection to the Diuine truth, I holde my selfe much indebted)
as I haue put foorth a generall Register of Sacred wordes,
with their significations, scattered throughout the whole
Bible, vnder the Names of three Right Reuerend persons, mine
especiall Benefactours. If by my Diuine Candle, there shall arise any light, for the
better vnderstanding of heauenly and Holie-Scriptures; let all glorie be giuen to him, who is
the Father of Lights, from whose Light, we all receiue
Light; and vnto whose blessed guiding & protection, I commit your Honor, with your
right Honorable and vertuous Lady, & hopeful Children.

RIght Reuerend, that which King
Asuerus saide of Mordechaie, when he found
by reading in the Chronicles the great pleasure he had done
him, by discouery of a dangerous treason against him,
What Honor and dignity (saith he) hath bin done
to him for this? The like (though not the same) may I
say, concerning your Lordships and Worship, vpon recording with my selfe,
the many and great fauours which you haue done me from my
youth, to this day: what duty and seruice (for I may not say,
what Dignity and Honour) hath bin returned to you for all
this? My Conscience doth aunswere me with some checke, as
his Seruants answered their King: There hath beene
nothing done. If vpon this aunswere, that
Heathen man entered into some deliberation with himselfe, how to
recompence Mordoche, my checke would proue a sting
in the end, if I should alwayes suffer my selfe to forget
your very great and most constant Good-will and benificence.
For one of you; to wit, my Lord of Carlile, was
vnder God, the foundation of all the learning and preferment
which I enioy, hauing cherrished me in his Colledge (whereof
he was a most



worthy Prouest and Gouernor, neglecting himselfe and his,
for the good of his house;) and afterward, sending mee to
the place where yet I abide, by Gods goodnesse; and there
haue beene, and still am much comforted through the great
loue & care of that Reuerend and most courteous Deane of
that Church, whereof I am a Member. The third, vouchsafing
me his louing respect, both long before and since hee was
aduanced to his first Sea.

Entering into some deliberation, what I might do, not for
dignifying you (albeit that were my part to do, were it in
my power) but for deliuering my selfe from suspition and imputation
of an ingratefull minde, I resolued to presume vpon your
great and well approued benignity and patience to dedicate to
you, and vnder your three names (being for your place and
painfulnesse, cheefe setters foorth, and teachers of Christianity)
to publish a great part of this my Christian
Dictionarie, which with much and long labour, and not
without some fruite (I hope) to the Godly Professors (for
whose sake and good, cheefely, I meant it) I am sure, vvith
much gaine of knowledge, and encrease of iudgement to my
selfe, I haue at length (as I could) finished it. Vnto
which, if your Honourable Lordships will affoord Patronage, Countenance, and
gracious Aspect, I shall in such wise, acquite some part of
bounden dutie towards you, as yet I will acknowledge my debt
encreased, by the addition of dignity vnto me,
so to grace this poore but painfull Work, as it may
haue shelter vnder your wings, against the carping Tongues
of the enuious, who neither
will put forth their strength to do good, nor yet will beare
with others, which desire to employ their Talents. Thus crauing
pardon of my boldnesse, and submitting my selfe and
endeuours to your fauourable acceptance, I commend you all three, to
him who is one in Essence, and three in persons; the Blessed
Trinitie, in vndeuideable Vnitie. Whose wisedome and power,
euer guide and defend you in earth, till his infinite
goodnesse and mercy, haue glorified you in heauen.

The Generall Preface, To the Christian
Reader.


THe end of Teaching, is to cause
others to learn; & to learne, is to know things to be,
what they are. Now of things to be knowne, words are notes
or markes, leading the minde
to the comprehension of the thinges. It cannot bee then, but
a great hinderance to the vnderstanding of
things; when words, which betoken and signify things, are
not vnderstanded; and a great furtheraunce, when they be
vnderstood. Wherefore, as it is necessary in Grammar
Schooles, that Children which learne French, Latine, or
Greeke, haue their Dictionaries and Lexicons allowed them,
to enterpret such harde and strange wordes, by knowledge
whereof, things to bee learned, become more easie; and their
labours, which haue composed such Bookes, are much to be
commended. So I haue wondered, that of so many, woorthy,



learned, and Godly Diuines, which are as willing for their
loue to the good of the Church, as able for their
sufficiency of gifts; not one, no not one (that I knowe)
haue euer attempted to prouide our Christian Scholler such a
Christian Dictionary of wordes, as containe the secrets of
our Heauenly profession and Art. Many haue framed and set
forth Primers, and A. B. Cs. for beginners; I
meane Catechismes, to enter them into the knowledge of God:
but not any (as yet) haue set too their hands, to enterpret
in our Mother tongue (in Alphabet order) the cheefe words of
our Science, which being very hard and darkesome, sound in
the eares of our weake Schollers, as Latine or Greeke words,
as indeede, many of them are deriued from these Languages;
and this I haue esteemed,
as no smal let to hinder the profiting in knowledge of holy
Scriptures amongst the vulgar; because, when in their
reading or hearing Scriptures, they meet with such
principall words, as carry with them the Marrowe and pith of
our holy Religion; they sticke at them, as at an vnknowne
language. Mathias Flaccius Illyricus (whom I did
not looke vpon, nor vppon Enchiridion Marlorati,
vntill I had well nie done this worke) hath worthily
performed this in Latine,
by whose helpe, it is easie for a Diuine to do some such
worke in English: I, the vnmeetest
and vnwoorthiest of all my Bretheren, not one of a thousand,
but the meanest of ten thousand; haue attempted this enterprise,
and performed a poore some-thing, sufficient onely, to giue
the more learned an occasion to do some more exact thing in
this kinde. Therefore, for their better encouragement thus
to doo, (besides the breach of the Ice vnto them) I haue
breefely set downe before them, the great and manifold
profits that would arise out of such a worke, being
substantially done. First of all, thy selfe, being a
Minister of the word, it wil bring thee this fruite, that
thou shalt teach with more facility, hauing readie and at
hand, the true and right definition of things. Secondly, the
distinguishing of wordes of



diuers acceptions, lying alwayes by thee, will ease thee of
some labour in searching, when thou art enforced by occasion
of the Text, to enterpret such words. Thirdly, the people
committed to thy charge, being by meanes of such a Booke,
well acquainted with the cheefe Wordes, which containe any
Doctrine, thou shalt not neede in the course of thy
teaching, to bee alwayes troubled with the opening of such
wordes; but presuming vppon their knowledge, maiest the more
insist and dwell in the pressing
and vrging the Doctrine and practise of the thinges so well
vnderstood before. Now, as touching the hearers, their growth and
proceeding in Christianitie, will be greater and more
speedy, by the help of such a Dictionary;
which hauing giuen light vnto them, to know the principall
wordes of their Art, the matter of Doctrine contained in
these words, and raised out of them, wil be sooner
perceiued, and take better impression. Againe, the right
distinguishing of thinges, the one from the other, when the
Nature and due bounds of euery worde is declared, would
proue some preseruatiue against errors and Heresie, which
commonly arise vpon the ignorance
of things, while they are shuffled confusedly
togither, one thing being
taken for another; or some thing being taken to bee that, it
is not. I could shew this in sundry particulers, one instead
of all: Iustification; this word, not rightly
vnderstood, what errors hath it bred? whilst some take it,
to bee the making of our selues iust, infusion of grace in
the hearts of the elect. Others, to be nothing else, but a
making of our actions to become iust and holy; whereas, it
is an absolution of a Sinner from his guiltinesse, and
pronouncing him righteous by God, when he beleeues in his
sonne Christ Iesus. Lastly, it will prouoke Christians more
willingly to reade Scriptures,
when they haue at hand a Dictionary, to declare and expound
such words as they vnderstand not. For, as men aduenture to
cracke that Nut, whose Kernell by cracking is to be
obtained; so the Christian is much moued



to read, when hee hath, as it were, a cracker to get him the
Kernell; that is, a Dictionarie to giue him the sence of the
words, which he reads. To conclude, it may preuent scruples,
which may arise in some Conscience,
through ignorance of words, and their true and fit meanings.

Now, a few Aduertisements will be requisite to bee added
about this my simple endeuour. First, my care was to put in
no words, but such as were material, & of some moment
and vse. Secondly, if either I haue left out some materiall
wordes, or not giuen all the significations of those whereof
I haue made choise, or giuen more then they haue, or not set
downe the significations for order, so precisely as would
be; let these faults (if any such be) be pardoned by thee,
till they be supplied by some more sufficient: for whom (as
I haue saide) I doo heerein but breake the Ice. Yet heereof,
I woulde haue them take knowledge, that such significations
as I giue, I find them in the word: but if any worde haue
other, or more, it is more then I finde. Thirdly, I would
haue none to think, that my meaning were to giue an exact
definition of euerie thing
(let him be thought verie wise and happie, that can do this)
but some true and familiar explication or description of words, to
make things that be obscure to become
somwhat plainer to the ignorant. Fourthly, these
explications which I do giue, may differ in tearmes from
such explications, as yee shall finde in other mens
Writings of the same
wordes. But I verily trust, that you shall finde for the
most part, an agreement in substaunce of truth. Moreouer, in
citing Scriptures, I haue sometime
noted such places, wherein the words which I doo interpret,
is onely named; Sometime, the place where the Interpretation
is found, with the word; and some places which only haue the
Interpretation, & not the word. I cite few places,
because the light giuen to a worde in one place, will clear
other places where that word is vsed in that same sence,
which the aduised Reader shall 



discerne by the circumstance of the place. Besides, I haue put some
Ecclesiasticall wordes, which be not found in Scripture, in
so many Sillables, yet are there for the
matter, as Trinity
and Sacrament, &c. Againe, sometime ye shall
finde the word, and sometime the thing, and
sometime both opened. Finally, my request is, that no
Minister do by this Booke
hinder his owne searching, it being intended to be a meane
rather to whet 
his diligence to search more narrowly: nor any hearer vse it
to contention, but to
edification; not for matter of ydle dispute, but for
needfull direction. And if I be longer in the
explanation of some
words, then the Nature of a Dictionary wil beare, or do open
some wordes, which (to some) may seeme needlesse; impute it
eyther vnto the waightinesse of the things, which being
darke and important, neede opening; or vnto the dulnesse of
common Capacities, which see little in diuine matters; or if
ye will, to want of dexterity in my selfe, who haue beene
but of late acquainted with this Trade. Thus entreating thee
(courteous Reader) to
haue consideration of my weakenesse, and of the newnesse and
strangenesse of the worke, fauourably
to pardon wants (which in such a forrest of words and
things, cannot but be many) I commend thee vnto the
mercifull goodnesse and protection of the
Almighty.

Thine to do thee good, Tho: Wilson.






A short Aduertisement, touching the
commodities of this
Booke, and the things performed
in it.


CVrteous Reader, albeit in my
generall Preface and particuler Rules, I haue some-what
discouered both my purpose, and the profit of this new
vnwonted worke; yet for thy
better encouragement to bestow the cost in buying, and paines
in Reading, I haue heere
distinctly and seuerally gathered the maine and manifold vses,
whereunto this Booke may serue, if it bee rightly vsed and not
abused, as euery Booke (euen the best) may be, and are.

1 The most wordes of Holy Scripture, both maine and
meane, both proper and borrowed; are heere plainely, and with
few words expounded and opened, to help the Minister to
interpret, and the hearers to vnderstand the Scriptures.

2 The sundry and diuers acceptions and scattered
sences of one and the same
word, are noted and gathered vnder one view, with fit places
of Scripture, agreeing to the diuersities
of the sence.

3 Where any word is by the Holy-Ghost drawne from his proper
sence, to an improper and figuratiue signification,



there ye haue the name of that Trope or Figure, set down
vnder that Word, whether it be
Metaphor or Metonimie, Irony, Sinecdoche,
or some other; by which meanes, the reason of pulling many
words from the Primitiue signification,
to a secondary, may appeare.

4 Besides single words, this Booke interpreteth very
many double words, compounded of
a Nowne & an Adiectiue, or Epithite. Also sundry
Scripture-Phrases be expounded.

5 In setting down the meaning of the words, this
Dictionary doth very often
point at some wholesome Doctrine, and sometime expresseth
it.

6 All the wordes of foundation (as I verily trust)
which contain the sure grounds of our Faith and Religion, are
heere comprehended.

7 Heere bee giuen the definitions of the Capitall and
chiefe matters, with due proofes of Scripture, to confirme
euery part of the definition, the better to expresse the
nature of things.

8 You shall find not a few Theologicall distinctions
and diuisions, the better to distinguish one thing from
another.

9 Not onely wordes, which beare difference betweene
Protestants and Papists, are written downe and cleared in this
Booke, but also there is a taste giuen, of the oddes and
difference it selfe, in
most points of Controuersie, between vs and them, for the
information of such as haue lesse profited, in discerning the
differences.

10 There bee two thousand Texts of Scripture (at the
least) declared and made plaine, to the vnderstanding of the
simplest.

11 Vnto such words as be hard or waighty, I haue
sometimes added, for fuller
edifycation, short and easie obseruations,
vnder this word [Note] being set in the Margent.



12 Lastly, this is not the least fruite that may come of
this Dictionary, to the studious and well minded Christian,
that it may cause him more narrowly to search and examine
what signifycation euery word of Scripture may beare: for
out of mine owne experience, I may truly speake it, that
since I took this Booke in hand, it hath caused me a great
deale more thoroughly to
marke the Scriptures, the sweete proportion and large
compasse whereof, I know much better then euer I did.






Differences betweene this Booke, and M. WILLIAM
KNIGHTS.


1 HIs Booke is a Concordance, mine is a
Dictionary.

2 His is Axiamaticall, of simple propositions; mine
is partly Verbaticall and Rematicall, as I may so speake, of
Wordes with their signifycations: partly, Pragmaticall of
things, with their Defynitions, Diuisions, and Obseruations
Theologicall.

3 His serues for Doctrines, Reasons, & Vses;
mine serues most for interpretations.

4 His helps Ministers to direct them to teach well;
mine may helpe all, but cheefely hearers, to direct them to
learne well. To be short, they do agree in nothing but the
Generall truth, and in following the order of the
Alphabet.






The Iudgement which a Godly Reuerend man (a Doctor of
Diuinity) gaue of this Booke, in a Letter of his to the
Author, after he had seene some part of it.


MY leasure would not suffer me to
read so much of your Dictionary, as I wish I had: but that I
haue perused, giueth me that
good liking of it, that I assure you, I do take it to bee a
very profitable worke, both in regard of the easie Method and
order of finding out such matters
as are therein contained; as also, for the sound exposition of
such Wordes and phrases as you set downe: besides, the
manifolde variety of thinges, which a man shall see in a
Synopsis laide before his eyes. Of all which, the
faithfull Reader (especially the Preacher of the word) shall
make singular vse. I must therefore giue my best approbation
to this worke of yours, as to other your godly labours in this
kinde: and when it shall be finished, I shall bee glad to vse
the benefit of it, and will aduise such as I am acquainted
with, to do the like. Fare ye well.

WHosoeuer dooth but cast his eye ouer any part of this
Worke, must confesse it to bee both painefull and ingenious:
And (which addeth much to the commendation of it) this addeth
not to any that went before. It is farre more easie to adde,
then to inuent: and for ought that I know, the
Author doth not build vpon any
other Mans foundation in
this kinde. But that which Crowneth this, and all such
Christian endeuours, is, the subiect whereabout it doth
conuerse. For though it bee a Dictionary interpreting Words
and Phrases; yet is it a Diuine Dictionary, teaching the
Language of the Holy-Ghost in our owne Natiue toong, which if
a man could once attaine to speake Naturally and kindly, he
would be more powerfully eloquent, then if he spake with the
tongues of men and Angels.

Scriptures.


IT is the Custome of worldly men,
so sure to lay vp their earthly Treasure, as there is no
comming to it without a Key, because it is kept vnder locke,
or lockes rather. Thus it fareth with the Heauenly
neuer-withering Treasure, which being (as it were) lockt vp
from all men (as they be the Sonnes of Adam) cannot
be enioyed of them, without
the helpe of a double Key. One, is meerely Spirituall and
Principally held and kept in his hand, which hath the Keyes of
the house of Dauid, to open the wits and
vnderstanding of such as
bee blinde by Nature. Luke 24, 45. and still more and
more to illuminate such as bee alreadie taught of God.
Psal. 119, 18. The other, is so Spirituall, as it is
also Ministeriall; to wit, the Interpretation of Scriptures,
eyther by vocall preaching, or by sounde
Writing of such Scribes as be
skilfull to open the worde of the kingdome. The former Key,
thy humble faithfull Prayers
must prouide, beseeching God thy Father most
instantly, in the name of
his sonne, to open thine eyes to make thee able to see the
wonders of his Law. The latter (as from many other Diuine
Lock-smiths) so from this Authour is ministred to thee in this
present Booke; full of labour, and very lightsome. What
remayneth, but that as a naturall man would be glad of a Key,
to open the Lock where much Gold and Siluer is stored vp: so
thou shouldst ioyfully embrace
this worke, which leadeth thee to a Treasure more to be
desired then Gold; yea, then much fine Gold.
Farewell.

A Friendly Counsell to the Christian Reader,
touching the vse and benefit of this Booke.


WOuldst thou, as all Gods children would, conceiue & vnderstand
What thou doost read in holy writ, as God doth thee command?

Ioh 5. 39.
Mat 22, 29.
2 Cor 4. 7.
Eph 3, 8

Wouldst thou attaine true sence of words, and matter in them hid,
What meaning each word doth containe, from error to be rid?
Doost thou delight to haue in-sight into the Sacred Treasure
Of Christs riches, and with thy fill therein to take thy pleasure?
Then read this worke, which painfull hand hath wrought to ease thy paine,
That in reading Gods holy word, thou mayst reape greater gaine.
Our English tongue, from many tongues, a snatch and smacke hath taken:
As English-men, from forraigne men, their Coats and Sutes haue shapen.
Some words from French, and some from Greeks, mo from the Latines flow.
Some new, some olde; some darke, some plaine, some hard & strange to know.
Some, to some place do giue great light; some darken much some Text;
Some generall in the first place, some speciall in the next.
Some properly sound in this clause, improperly in that:
What some words sound thou knowest right well; some sound thou knowst not what
So, oft-times thou leau'st off to read and search the holy Scriptures,
Because thou vnderstand'st not words, which hide their heauenly Treasures.
But lay this Booke on thy left hand, and Bible on thy right;
When doubt ariseth from a word, on Booke straight cast thy sight.
It will soone helpe to cleare thy doubts, and make plaine Text to thee,

Col. 1, 10.
Ioh 13. 17,
and 17. 3.
Ia. 1, 22.

That thou shalt know what God doth meane, and well his counsell see.
So shalt thou read, and in reading, encrease thy knowledge daily,
And knowledge of our God and Christ, with practise, makes men happy.

IT is a speciall duty of a good Teacher, to know and
deliuer the sound and fit sence of the places and Texts of
Scriptures; and of euery good hearer to looke after the same,
how to vnderstand rightly what he heareth and readeth. In this
behalfe, how much the Church of God is beholding to that
learned iudicious Writer, M.
Caluin, all that are learned, do wel know, and
willingly confesse: For when hee meetes with a place, wherein
he seeth men haue made scruple,
he doth in the end (after some sifting of the
matter) strike the Nayle full
on the head, with his resolute
Census est, This is the sence or meaning of the
place. And surely, we ought thankfully to receiue what heere
this Author (though in many other
respects, and in this also,
farre inferiour to Caluin, out of whom he will
acknowledge to haue suckt his best knowledge) painfully and
freely offereth vnto vs, who heerein imitateth M:
Caluin; For, as the one beates out the meaning of a
sentence, so this present Writer,
labours to presse and draw out the Kernel, which lyes hidde
and wrapt in some obscure and doubtfull words. Finally, in
humblenesse of heart, apply thy selfe to profit by this &
other such profitable Books, as are framed to the edification
of the godly Christians,
in their most holy faith. Farewell.

To the Christian Reader


ALthough words be the significations of things, yet as
Aug. de doct. Christ. lib. 4. and cap. 11. saith
verie well: It is a note of the best & wisest men, In
verbis, verum amare, non verba, quid enim prodest clauis aurea
si aperire quod volumus non
potest? Aut quid obestlignea, si hoc potest, &c. In
words, to loue the truth more then the wordes; For what
anayleth a Key of Gold, if it cannot open the Treasure that we
would faine enioy? Or what hindereth
a Key of Wood, if it can open it, &c. Lewes Viues
hath fitly obserued out of
Augustin de ciu: dei lib. 13. cap. 24. Quanti sit momenti
ad omnes artes disciplinasque intelligendas vera & Germana
vocabularum cognitio. The true and proper signification
and knowledge of words, is a matter
of great moment and consequence to the vnderstanding of all
Artes. It is verie fit therefore (good Reader) thou shouldst
imitate the wise Traueller, he will be carefull to attaine to
as much skill as may bee in the Languages of all those parts
and Countries through which he is to passe, that he may with
the fewer inconueniences, be
interrupted in the way, and with greater expedition may runne
his intended race and iourney: So thou, in thine intended
iourney to Canaan, if thou be
ignorant of the Language, Customes, Wordes, Phrases,
Meanings, and Orders of the
place and Countrey, wilt meete with a World of
inconueniences, to
interrupt thine intention, and discourage thee in thy course,
so as thou wilt either leaue off, or verie faintly and
vncomfortably go forward. For as the same Augustine
saith again verie truly, Nam aut ignotum verbu~, facit
haerere lectorem, antignota locutio; Either an vnknown
word causeth the Reader to
sticke, or an vnknowne Phrase and manner of speaking. Vse
therefore this Booke, which God hath affoorded for thy good,
and for thy guide, reade it diligently, and be much conuersant
therein, it will be a faithfull guide and
Interpreter vnto thee; It
will bring thee acquainted with the Language, Phrase, and
Customes of Canaan; It will open vnto thee the hidden
Treasures of heauenly
Wisedome, and it will tell thee in plaine English and
easie tearmes, the minde and meaning of thy good God towards
thee. Entertaine it kindly, and take it vp vnto thee, as that
Noble Eunuch did his guide Phillip. Acts 8, 31, 39.
and it will make thee (as he did) go thy iourney with ioy and
chearefulnesse. As the Sea-men and Marriners in their Voyages,
bee carefull to bring ὀρθὰν τὰν νᾶος so be thou in
thine, as carefull to bring ὀρθὸν τὸν νzοῦν , an
vpright and sincere minde; and
I doubt not, but thou shalt find it κατὰ νzοῦν, euen
according to thy hearts desire, and answereable to thine
expectation. Farewell.

CVrteous Reader, thou art much bound
to blesse God, for the great plenty and aboundance of
excellent Bookes, which by the handes of his painefull and
godly Seruants he hath afforded thee, as helps and
furtherances to bring thee to the sound knowledge, and right
vnderstanding of his sacred word: But among them all, in my
iudgement, there is no one in our Natiue tongue, that dooth
more oblige thee to true thankfulnesse, then the Booke thou
now beholdest, in regard of
the great necessity and manifolde vse of the same; as also
the exceeding rich profit and benefite, which (by Gods
blessing, if thou make the right vse of it) thou mayst reap
thereby. For beside the multiplicity and great variety of
wholesome matter, which thou shalt finde scattered through
the whole worke, heere thou hast most of the dark words and
phrases contained in the Scripture, in Alphabeticall order;
plainely, breefely, (yet fully) and soundly vnfolded; and in most
places, the corrupt glosses of the Papists vpon them,
compendiously discouered and confuted. Heere thou maist at
one view, see the diuers acceptations and significations of
words, with the figures and Tropes denoted, in which the
Scripture vseth them. By this Book, thou shalt be made able
to distinguish of words, which in Scripture are ambiguous,
to explaine wordes and phrases obscure, and easily to
vnderstand such as bee hard and vnknowne. By this Booke,
if thou be a Minister, thou shalt become Bonus
Textuarius (for what is that but to bee able to giue
the true meaning and gemine sense of the Scripture?) and
bonus Textuarius est bonus Theologus. This Booke
will make thee a more profitable teacher; for qui bene
distinguit, bene decet. By this Booke (whosoeuer thou
be) thou shalt be fortified to shield thy selfe (and haply
others too) from errour, as
also to see when others do erre, and to draw them out of
errour; for errour springes from ignorance; that is, from
misvnderstanding the Scripture. Math. 22, 29. By this thou
shalt bee made skilfull, to discerne



the voyce of thy Shepheard Christ Iesus, from the voyce of a
stranger. Iohn 10, 3, 5. In a word, by this book in short
space, and with no great labour, thou mayst plentifully abound in
all heauenly wisedome and knowledge. So that, as one saith
of Cicero; Sciat se multum profecisse, cui Cicero vnice
placet; In like manner, it may more truelie be affirmed
of this Booke; whosoeuer he bee that delighteth much in it,
shall thereby gaine infinite benefit. The Authour hath beene
pleased to entitle this Booke A Christian Dictionary,
and so it is; for it interprets wordes. But it may also be
worthily called; The Key of the Treasures hid in holy
Scripture; the enemy of Ignorance; The high and ready path to Knowledge; The
Discloser of Gods holy secrets; A light for Ministers, 
whereat they may borrow light; A Lanthorne for the people,
to direct them in the Light: And to bee short, the way
to make all the Lords people to prophesie, as Moses
wished. Then Gentle Reader, be not without it, let it be
continnally by thee, yet buy it not for Nouelty, because it
is the first of this kinde that euer saw the light; but for
the vnualuable worth of it. Sit tibi charus, non quia
rarus, sed amatus quod amabilis; 1. amari dignus.
Seneca saith; Noua, quamuis non magna,
miramur. That we make much of new things, though they
bee not great. Loe, in this Booke, they both meete together,
heere is newnesse, and heere is goodnesse. This worke is
new, and it is precious,
how then, should it not much Inamour thee?

Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit vtile dulci.

The Epitome and Anatomy of this Booke, abridged and vnbowelled.


AS Starres from Heauen much light afford,
So do the words we find in Word.
But Starres shine not till they appeare,
Nor Words do teach, till sence we heare.
Then read this Booke, that thou mayst spie
Gods mind; thy minde to rectifie.
The signes of things it maketh bare,

1. Significations.
2. Definitions.
3. Distinctions.

The things themselues it doth declare;
Yea thing from thing it seuereth plaine,
That better knowledge thou mayst gaine.
What oddes twixt truth and error is,

4. Controuersall
words.
5. Fundamentall.

It sheweth eke, attend to this:
The words which Fundamentall be,
Are all in Table placst for thee.
Eke words, whose matter Scriptures cleare,

6. Ecclesiasticall.

Yet Words themselues do not appeare.
Praise God, apply thy minde to know

Required vnto right vse
of all.
1. Thankefulnesse.
2. Humility.
3. Prayer.

All Words of his, both hie and low:
With humble heart this Booke admit,
And pray for grace to thriue by it.

A Preface before the Table.


GEntle Reader, in this vast Ocean,
and large Forrest of words contained in this
Dictionary, I doe find
that there be three sorts most materiall; where of I desire
that thou sholdst take more especiall notice and knowledge, as
being of more worth and waight. The first I call an
Ecclesiasticall word, which being translated from common vse
of speech, is by the Church appropriated,
to signifie holy and diuine things. A word of this kind,
though it be not in the Scripture for Letter and Sillables:
yet is to be found there for matter and substance; as
Trinity, &c. Sacrament,
Indifferent, Satisfaction, Merit, &c.

A word of the second rancke, I doe tearme
Polemicall; because it pertaines to Controuersie,
& hath in it a ground of difference betweene the true
Christian, which thinketh, speaketh, and writeth
Orthodoxally, and soundly; and
others, which loue and embrace
errors, in fauour where of they wrest, and peruert the pure
wordes of Scripture: as Iustification, Assurance, of
Faith, Hope of Glory, Concupiscence,
Antichrist, &c.

A word of the third sort, is called Fundamentall,
of which kind, I doe take such wordes to be, as doe containe
in them things, which beeing denyed, Religion it selfe is
ouerthrowne; euen as an house is ouer-turned, by taking away
the foundation or ground-worke whereuppon it stands; as
Grace, Fayth, God, Christ, &c. for the
descerning of these words
from other, I iudge this to be a
necessary rule.

A word, containing in it anything, which being denyed,

A Rule
whereby to
iudge a fun­
damentall
word.

either God himselfe, any person of the God-head, the decrees
of God, his properties, his workes of Creation and
prouidence, his word of Law and Gospell: or Christ Iesus the
Mediator, his Person, Natures, Offices, benefits,



Church, and people be denied; either directly, or by necessary and immediate
consequence. Any such word is Fundamentall, for
that must needs be the foundation of an House, which being
remooued, the house cannot but fall. Of this Nature be the
wordes, vpon deniall whereof, followes
the ruine of the whole Fabricke of Religion.

Of these three kindes of words, I haue heere drawne a Table
after the order of the Alphabet, setting a Starre * before an
Ecclesiasticall word, to know it by. I haue
prefixed this sillable
[Con] aboue a Polemical word, and haue placed an
[F] ouer the head of a fundamentall word: where it
happeneth, that any one word is both an
Ecclesiasticall, & a word of
Controuersie, I haue written vpon the top of it, both
a Star, and this sillable [Con.] Also, you shall find
this sillable [Con] and an [F] ouer euery
word, which is both Polemicall, and a word of
Foundation.

Moreouer, whereas I haue with the explication of words,
sometimes ioyned the definition of the thing expressed by such
a word, ye shall finde this sillable [Def.] put vnder
the foote of such a word. And those words in this Table that
doe admit distinctions, they are noted out by this sillable
[Dist.] directly put vnder the word.

Finally, if in the draught, either of this Table, or of
this whole Dictionary, I haue failed in any thing (as no doubt
but I haue, being but a man; and therefore subiect to
error, from which no Booke is
priuiledged, sauing the book of Bookes,) I do earnestly
entreate thee to couer my slips by loue, eyther amending them,
or admonishing mee of them: doing vnto me, as in the like case
thy selfe wouldest bee done vnto: euer remembring, that it is
much easier to dislike, then to doe the like. The former, will
cost thee nothing; but the
latter (trust me) will cost thee paines, vnto sweate and
wearinesse, if thou wilt but endeuour to doe what I haue done
before thee.

Farewell.

Abba. sig
FAther; Thus Christ expoundeth
it, Mark. 14, 36. and Paul, Rom. 8, 15.
to cry Abba Father: the doubling of the worde,
ioyning to the Syriacke [Abba] the Greeke word
πατύρ, serueth
to teach, that God, is not God of the Iewes onely, but of
the Gentiles also, and will be called vpon in all
Languages, requiring of his people a strong confidence in
his fatherly goodnes through Christ.

To abhorre sig:
To haue a thing in vtter detestation and
loathing, Esay.
1, 13. I abhor your Sabbothes and newe Moones.
Iob. 42, 6. I abhor my selfe. Sometimes
abhorring, signifies loathing in shew and profession only,
and not in truth: as Rom. 2, 22. Thou
abhorrest Idols: that is; seemest to detest them.

Abhomination.
sig:
Some accursed spirituall filthinesse which
deserues to be fled from
and abhorred of all men, as ominous, fearful, &

Abhomination
of Desolation.
sig:
That, which all good men detest and hold
accursed, by reason of

of it, deseruing and bringing desolation. And this is
meant (as some thinke) of the Idolles which



the Romans not long after Christ his Ascention,
set vp in the Temple at Ierusalem, whereupon
followed desolation, that is; the laying wast and
downfall of the Temple, Citty, and Nation of the Iewes:
this is the abhomination of desolation fore-spoken of by
Daniell 9, 27. and after spoken of by
Mat. 24, 15. But Maister Iunius (not
without great apparance of reason) interpreteth
[Abhomination] of the Army of the
Romans, which consisted of abhominable men, to
wit, Infidels, who brought desolation vpon
Temple, Citty, and
people.

Absence, referred
to God. sig:
His with-holding some signe of his fauor, or the
sending some Iudgement. For as touching his
essence and power, he is
neuer absent from his Creatures,

& elsewhere, of hiding his face, turning his back,
departing, returning,
and such like.

To seperate, or estrange, & turne our mind from a
thing, with an hatred of it. 1. Pet. 2, 11.

euill. Mat. 12, 24. Of the abundance of the

aboundantly and
plentifully, Rom. 5, 20. Where sin

This is the acceptation of our persons.

2 To approue graciously our vnperfect &
spotted workes, by the
free forgiuenesse through Christ of those wants and
faultes which sticke vnto them. 1. Pet. 2, 5.
Psal. 51, 19. Then thou shalt accept our

works.

Acception of person. sig

outwarde quality, as of Nation, Riches, Kinred, Honour,
friend-ship, and such like, Acts 10, 34. God
is no accepter of persons, for in euery Nation, he that
feareth God is accepted. Rom. 2, 11. There is then no
cause why any should deny the eternall election of God,
depending vppon his owne good pleasure alone, as the
moouing cause, least he bee counted an accepter of
persons.

Accesse. sig:
A drawing toward or comming neerer, Rom. 5, 2.
We haue accesse vnto this grace, &c. that is,

through Christ, apprehended and laid holde on euen by
faith.

certainly, and clearely then wee were wont to do.
Luke 1, 4. That thou maist Acknowledge,

3 Openly and frankely to vtter and shew foorth our
knowne sinnes, or Gods owne perfections, 1. Iohn
1, 6. If we acknowledge our sins. Psalme. 32,
5.

4.

Then I acknowledged my sins vnto the, &c.

4. To take others for such as they are, louing them,
and hauing



them in due account. Thes. 5, 12.
Acknowledge them that admonish you, and haue them
in singular loue for their Worke. Note this
generally, that

To lay an euill or fault to ones charge; This is done,
either truly, or falsely; secretly, or openly.

Actes 24, 13, 19. Men accuse God, one man accuseth
another, and Sathan
accuseth the Bretheren, also our owne thoughts do accuse
vs. Reuel. 12, Rom. 2, 15.

Accursed. sig:
Seperate from all humaine vse, and appoynted to
temporall destruction. Ios. 6, 20, 21, Keepe
yee from the accursed thing.

2 Seperate from Christ, and appointed to
eternall destruction.
Gal. 1, 9. Let him be accursed. Rom. 9,
3. I would be accursed or (seperate from Christ) for
my Kinsmen. In these words, holy Paule
maketh no such prayer or wish, that hee might perish (for
this had beene vnlawfull and vaine too, both agaynst the
constant purpose of God, and his owne
assurance testified,
Rom. 8, 38, 39. Neither was Paule bound
to loue the Iewes saluation more then christ and his
grace) but by this manner of speech, beeing conditionall,
hee bewrayes his deepe affection for the Iewes his
kinsmen, in that (if it could haue bin) hee was ready to
haue redeemed their eternall destruction
with his owne.


A. D.

Adde. sig:
To put vnto, Reuel: 22, 18. If any man
shall adde to these things in this Booke, &c.
Prou. 30, 6. Put nothing



his word. Deut. 12, 32. Men adde to the word of
God, when they put some-thing to the seruice of God,
which he hath not commaunded for his
Seruice: or do make
that to be Scripture, which is not Scripture, putting to
it somewhat which is false, or taking from it somewhat
which is true. Thus do the Romanists, as a man
halfe blind, may see.

2 To cast in some-thing as a surplusage and
ouerplus, Mat.
6, 33. All other things shall bee added (or ministred)
vnto you.

with encrease of wrath. Reuel. 22, 10. I wil
adde vnto him all the plagues, &c.

purpose.

2 A taking, or admitting one actually to be a son by
fauour, who is none by nature; and to adopt, is actually
to take him for a son, who was the childe of wrath by
nature. Rom. 8, 15. Ye haue receiued the
spirit of adoption. Actuall adoption.



3 The dignity of being Gods people. Rom. 9, 4.
To whom pertains the adoption. This is external
adoption.

Heb: 13, 4. Adulterers God will Iudge.
Iohn 8, 3. A Woman taken in adultery.

2 All maner of vncleannes, about desire of sex,
together with the occasions, causes, and meanes thereof,
as in the 7. Commandement. Exod: 20, 14.

Aduocate. sig: pro
 One, that pleadeth for another at any barre of Iustice.
This is the proper signification.

2 One, that pleadeth the cause of beleeuing
sinners

Note.

at the barre of Gods Iustice. Christ alone
performes this office,
by the euerlasting merite of his death. 1. Iohn
2, 2. We haue an

All Wordes, which concerne Christ his mediation, are to be vnderstood exclusiuely, shutting out all creatures.

Aduocate with the Father, Iesus Christ the
righteous. Heere fals downe the multitude of
Aduocates set vp in the Romish Synagogue, to

Propitiator, or
Reconciler.

A. G.

Against Christ. sig
Haters of Christ, and open Blasphemers, Math.
12, 30. He that is not with me, is against mee.
They were not against Christ, which did think
reuerendly of him,
though they did not follow him, & make open profession
of him; but such, as reproched him, his Doctrine, and
works, are heere said to be against him. As appeareth by
comparing together the 30, 31, and 32, verses of the
12. Chapter of Saint Mathew.

Agony. sig: pro
 Any fight, conflict, wrestling, or strife.

2 The deepe soul-sorrow and extreame anguish of Christ,
wrestling, and striuing, not only with the terror of
death, but with the infinit Iustice & wrath of God,
highly displeased with our sinnes, Luke 22, 44.
And he was in an agony, &c. If any thinke,
this Agony did arise meerely from a feare of Naturall
death in Christ, they thinke too vnwoorthily of Christ his
excellent fortitude, of his Fathers infinite Iustice, of
mans most horrible and execrable sinnes.


A. L.

All. sig:
Euery one, & then it is put vniuersally,
Rom. 5, 12. Death went ouer all. 2.
Cor: 5, 10. Wee must all
appeare, that is,
all and euery one.

2 Some of al: and then it is put indefinitly. 1,
Tim. 2, 2. God will haue all to be saued:
Mat. 3, 5, & 4, 24. And he healed all
diseases: that is, some of all sortes and kindes.
Iohn 6, 45. These and such like places
therefore, are euilly cited in fauour of
vniuersall election



to proue that all and euery one were chosen, and that
the cause of their damnation which do
perish, is because they
refused offered grace.

3 Plentifull and perfect, Rom. 15, 13. All
Ioy. 1, Cor. 13, 2. All
knowledge.


A. L.

Allegory. sig:
A sentence consisting of sundry strange and
borrowed speeches, which
sound one thing, and couertly
shewes forth another. Gal. 4, 24. Mat.
7, 6. & Mat. 3, 10, 11. affoord vs examples
heereof. Allegories bee
either continued Metaphors, whereof many examples are in
Scriptures besides those heere named: or a drawing of some
words plainly vttered at first, from their naturall and
proper meaning, to a strange sense, for better instruction
of our minds, in some points of faith or manners, as that
in Gala. 4, 24. Touching the latter kinde of
Allegories, it is a safe thing to tread in the steps of
the holy ghost, not making Allegoricall sences, where the
Spirit hath made none.

Almes. sig:
A releefe giuen to the poore out of a pitiful hart,
Mat. 6, 1. When thou giuest thy Almes,
&c. It hath affection of mercy, and effect of succour;
the heart touched with pittifulnesse, and an hande reached
out to giue if we haue wherewith. See 2. Cor.
8.

Almightie. sig:
One of infinite power, able to do whatsoeuer he will,
and to hinder whatsoeuer hee will not haue done by his
respectiue power, and by his absolute power able to doo
more then he will; such a one is God onely, 2.
Cor. 6, 18. Saith the Lorde God
Almighty. Rom. 9,
19. Who hath resisted his will? The Papists
reason foolishly from Gods Almightinesse, to proue the
reall presence of Christes body in the supper: whereas
they should rather prooue it is his reuealed will to
haue it so, which they can neuer do. Wee may assure our
selues that God is able to do, and doth whatsoeuer he is
willing to doo, but



not on the contrary, that he will do whatsoeuer hee can
do. Note further, that if God could do things against
his Nature, or thinges contradictory, or
against his word, it
would bewray impotencie, and weakenesse, not Omnipotency
and Almightinesse.

Alpha. sig:
That which is first amongest the Greeke Letters, as
Omega is that Letter which is last: whereby is
meant, that Christ is both beginning and ending,
Re. 1, 11. I am Alpha & Omega, the first
and the last.

All-sufficient.
sig:
One God, most able to performe all promised good
things, and to keepe away al threatned euils,
Gen. 17, 1. I am God All-sufficient.

Altar. sig:
The Doctrine of free saluation by Christ
crucified: or the
sacrifice of Christs death, Heb. 13, 10. We
haue an Altar, &c. The meaning of this place is,
that such as remayne (after due instructions) in the
obseruations of Legall-Sacrifices, shal not
partake in the Sacrifice
of Christs death, once offered on the crosse. What is this
to Popish Altars, whereon
to Sacrifice Christ againe in an vnbloody
maner for sinnes of the
quicke in earth, and of the dead in Purgatory?

2 The Sacrifices and Oblations, slain and
offered at the Altar, 1
Cor. 9, 13. They which serue at the Altar,
are partakers with the Altar.

To offer, or bring our guift to the Altar.
sig:
To do and performe the duty of godlines, which are vnto
God as an Oblation or Sacrifice, Mat. 5, 23, 24.
Therefore if thou shalt bring thy guift to the
Altar, &c. It is a speech borrowed from those
times, when the Temple, and Altars, and
Sacrifices were in vse.
Therefore the Papists deale absurdly,
which vpon these words, would build theyr
Altars for Masses, and
their Purgatory: woful Interpreters
of Scriptures.


A. M.

Am. sig:
Existence or selfe-being, Exod. 3, 14. I am
that I am; that is, I haue my being from my selfe, and



from no other, and am the cause of beeing to all things
that be.

2 Representating, or resembling, Iohn 15, 1.
I am that Vine: that is, I represent, & am
like vnto a vine.

Amen. sig:
In the end of Prayer, a wishing that it may bee so, as
wee aske, and a trusting that it shall bee so:
Gal. 1, 5. To whom be glorie for euer and
euer: Amen.

2 Vehement asseueration, when a thing is
earnestly and strongly
affirmed. Mat. 18, 3. Amen I say vnto
you.

3 Certaine, constant, or most firme, 2. Cor:
1, 20. Yea and Amen.

4 Trueth it selfe, Reuel: 3, 14. These
things sayeth
Amen.

To Amend. sig:
To redresse and reforme faultes. It is put for
repentance,
Math. 3, 8. Actes 26, 20. Bring foorth
fruites woorthy of Repentance (or amendment.) Repentaunce
is as the roote, amendment as the fruite. First, there
must bee a chaunge of the heart from euil to good, by the
guift of repentance put into it of God, and then will
followe, an amendment
and redresse of our wayes and maners.


A. N.

Anathema. sig:
One, whych is accursed, or an execration,
seperate, and remooued
from the fellow-shippe of the faythfull. Sometime also
from the grace of Christ, and hope of saluation.
Anathema Maranatha is one accursed for euer and a
day, or eternal execration,
1. Cor. 16, 21. If any loue not the Lorde
Iesus, let him be Anathema Maranatha. Anathema
belongs to all obstinate,
scandalous offenders. Anathema
Maranatha belongs onely to Blasphemers of the Holy
Ghost. Gala. 1, 9. Let him be
Anathema, accursed.
Rom. 9, 2. I could wish to be
Anathema for my
Kinsmen, &c.

2 A thing separate from common vse, and gyuen vnto GOD
to serue for holye vses, as beeing




It may seeme straunge that one word should be put not only in a diuers, but quite 
contrary signification. Som think it be be­
cause the verbe whence it com­
meth, hath divers acceptions. O­
thers think the word which sig:
things consecrate, in Luk. 21. to be
writ with (H) & the other word
with (E) But I thinke they both
are thus called of separating or 
departing either to destruction,
as the former, or to honourable 
vse, as the latter.

consecrate thereunto. Lu. 21, 5. and with
consecrate things, the word is Anathemata
in the original, & significs
Donaria or gifts hanged
vpon the pillers of the temple for ornament of the
place, and to the honor of God.

And. sig:
Because. 1. Cor. 8, 4. Col. 1, 24.
Heere it is a particle causall, as Marke 9, 49.
And euery Sacrifice, &c. 2. It is a note
similitude.

3 Therefore, Marke 10, 26. And they

his Cleargy, who are the Ring-leaders of that generall

deceiued, which will haue Antichrist to be one man; a

Rheimes, (to proue Peter to be at

Therefore must needs bee the See of Antichrist.

Baptisme, what it is?

be of the Couenant, but our being in it, is thereby
sealed and assured. Rom. 4, 11.
Circumcision as
a seale of the righteousnesse of faith. It is an
error



in Popery, to hold, that in Baptism, natural
concupiscence is
taken away, not onely touching guilt, but touching
corruption too, to be no sinne.

More fully thus:

It is the solemne dipping into, or washing in
water at the commandement of
Christ, in the name of the blessed Trinity; by this

 An hurtfull word, or any euill speech.

2 Euery reproachfull word, tending to the hurt and
disgrace of any other mans name and credite.
Titus 3, 2. Speake euill of no man. In
the Originall, it is [Blaspheme no man.]
Likewise, in 1. Pet: 4, 4. Therefore speake

Religion, of his Word, Ordinances, Creatures, or Workes.
Rom: 2, 24. For the name of God is
blasphemed amongst the
Gentiles through you. Tim: 6, 1.
Examples of this kinde of
blasphemy, we haue in Acts 14, 11: and 25, 19. where
Festus called Gods Religion,
Superstition. 2. Kinges 18, 35. This is the
blaspheming of God.

4 A malicious reproachfull word, vttered against



the knowne truth of the Gospell: This knowledge of the
Gospell, because it is had by the effectuall enlightning
of the spirit; therefore, the sin of one who maliciously
reproacheth this truth once knowne, is named blasphemy
against the Spirit, that is, not against the person, but
against the work of the spirite in man, illuminating his
soule to see the truth of Saluation. This is
Blaspheming agaynst the Spirit.

A more ample description of the sinne against the
Holy-ghost, for help of weake tempted
Christians.

Blasphemy against the spirit, it is a Sinne not in
deeds and actions, but in a reproachful word
(Mark 3, 30) vttered not out of feare, nor
other infirmitie, as Peter did, and sicke and
franticke personnes may do; but out of a malicious
hatefull heart. 1. Cor: 16, 22. and
Heb: 10, 26. Not by one that is ignorant of
Christ, as Paule was being a blinde Pharisie;
but by one enlightned through the Holy-Ghost with the
knowledge of the Gospel (Heb: 6. 4.) Not of
rashnes, but of set
purpose, to despite Christ his known Doctrine and workes
(Heb: 10, 29). Being
accompanyed with an
vniuersal defection, or falling away from the whole
truth of God (Heb: 6, 6) Also with a generall
pollution and filthinesse of life (Mat: 12, 45.
2. Pet: 2, 20) Finally, being vnremissible,
because such as commit
this sin, cannot repent (Mat: 12, 32.
Heb: 6, 6.) How are the Papists out of the way
touching this point, in that they wil haue this
Blasphemy to haue six parts or signes; whereof the
chiefe is finall impenitency, which doo
accompanie euery sin
in the wicked. Sée their note on Math.
12, 45.

To Blesse. sig:
To giue thankes, or to praise God in a solemne

in al places where the Saints are said

We blesse God when we praise him. God blesseth vs, either when be sendeth good things vnto vs, 
or remooueth euill thinges from vs, or turneth all to our good: wee blesse one another
by our mutuall prayers.

to blesse God, there it is meant, of their
Thankesgiuing, and of speaking well of God. The
Papistes, by blessing, vnderstand not a solemne
blessing, by giuing thankes to GOD, to the consecrating
or preparing the Creatures to an holye action; but an
operatiue blessing of the bread, making it to bee the
body of Christ substantially
and corporally: Sée the Annot. on Math.
26, 26.

2 To wish and pray for good thinges to others.
Gen: 48, 20. Iacob blessed the sonnes of
Ioseph. Such was the Priests blessing the people in
the Law, and parents blessing their children, euen their
good Prayers to God for their welfare.

3 To encrease that which is little, and to make it
much, as when God is sayde to haue blessed the Widdow of
Sarepta her Oyle & Meale in her Cruse. 2.
Kings 17, 16. And when Christ blessed the fiue
Loaues and two Fishes in the Gospell. This
blessing was operatiue
indeede, and wrought a sencible
multiplication of the Loaues, and Fishes; so was there not
a sencible mutation of the Bread and Wine into the body
and bloode of Christ by that blessing. Mat:
26.

4 To giue good things vnto vs, and to doo vs good in
prospering our affayres and labors. Psalme 67, 1.
God be mercifull vnto vs, and blesse vs: &
verse 6. Prou: 10, 22. The blessing of the
Lord maketh rich. Thus the word Blesse is
taken in good part.

5 To flatter and please ones selfe, and to boast of his
doings to others. Psal: 10, 2. The couetous
blesseth himselfe. Heere it is taken in euill
part.

6 The contrary, namely,

This is vsual in other tungs: as in Greeke, Enonyma, and Eumemined, good Names, for worse 
things, as Furies, &c. Old Latines for Nothing would say 
Well: Italians call loathsome diseases, Gods disease.

cursing, an Euphismos, when vnseemly things are
spoken in seemly words.



Iob: 1, 5. Least my sonnes haue
blessed God. (so it is in the Originall) that is;
Blasphemed. 1. Kings 20, 10. He hath blest
God and the King (so it is in the
Originall) for he
hath Blasphemed. Heere also it is taken in ill part.

Saluation, eyther in whole, as in all natural men.

in part we see, as in a glasse.

children.

Bloud of Christ. sig:
The death and whole sufferinges of Christ. One part of
his sufferings being put for all. Eph: 1, 7.
By whom we haue redemption through his blood. And
often in the
Romans, and Hebrewes, and throughout
Paules Epistles, is the bloud of Christ (one part
of his sufferinges) put Sinecdochically for the whole
sufferings, visible and inuisible. Therefore it is
absurd to stick to the
Letter, concluding from thence, that Christs outward
visible suffering were sufficient.
For from the Letter of Scripture, it wil follow, that if
this blood-shedding was enough, therefore his flesh might
be spared, and all the paines felte therein; also his
soule, with the heauinesse and sorrow
thereof, whereof there was as great need as of the rest.
For Christ suffered nothing in vaine, & our soule
hauing sinned, yea, and that principally, it was therefore
to be redeemed no lesse then our
bodies.

Blood of the Couenant. sig:

vnto which it is common, to

2 Beleeuers, which vpon the winges of a liuely faith
soare aloft, and mount vppe to Christ Iesus, whose
crucified flesh hath a sweete sauour, that
attracteth and draweth
them to him, as the sauour of the dead carkasse can cause
the Eagles to resort vnto it.
Luke 17, 37. Where the carkasse is, there
will the Eagles resort.


These senses and collections be not contrary, but diuerse: and may wel stand together.

Or thus: If there be such wit in Birdes (as
Eagles) that they will
come so farre to one carkasse, a great shame is it to
beleeuers, not to bee gathered to the Author of life, by
whom they are truely fed vnto an euerlasting life.

Or thus: As Eagles assemble to the Carrion: so the
beleeuer shall be perfectly ioyned to Christ, in despight
of Satan, according to that. 1. Thes. 4, 17.
And so they shall be euer with the Lord. When

happinesse in Heauen
at last, as hee that hath receiued an Earnest, is sure
to haue the ful summe paid him, or the full bargaine
aecomplished. Eph. 1, 14.
Also 2. Cor. 1,
22. And hath giuen the Earnest of the spirit.
In this sence, the Apostle in the fore-saide places,
vseth the similitude of a Seale, which also



serueth to confirme a promise; and therefore fit to
signifie, the assurance which the spirit of adoption
doth giue the faithful, of their inheritance in
heauen.

and he that beleeueth in me shall neuer thirst. This
is spirituall Eating.
Thus is the flesh of Christ eaten, when we do by faith
beleeue, that it was giuen for vs, and is the price of our
sins to God. The Capernaicall
and Papisticall Eating of Christ, is both
absurd and abhominable; for
so Infidels and wicked men; yea, very Mice and Rats may
eate him, and haue eternall life by him, if his very flesh
were corporally present
in the place where the Sacrament is administred.

Note.

Christ her husband imputed to her by faith, that she
might be without spot or wrinkle. Ephes. 5, 27.
Also she hath the Spirit of sanctification, to begin
holinesse in her selfe. 1. Pet. 1, 2. 2.
Cor. 6, 11. So as she is Faire, both
Imputatiuely, and incoatiuely, and at length shall be
Faire perfectly: and all this spiritually. For outwardly
she is blacke, afflicted, crossed, and persecuted in the
world. Cant. 1, 4.

Faith. sig: pro
 Truth and constancy in wordes and promises, when that
is performed in deede, which in wordes was spoken and
promised. Rom. 3, 3. Shall our
vnbeleefe make the faith
of God of none effect? Psal. 25, 10. Ps. 86, 15. And
in all other places where God is commended for Mercy and
Truth. The word in the Originall signifies [Faith.]
Gal. 5, 22. Math. 23, 23.

Metanimie of the Adiunct for the Subiect.

promises made in the Old Testament. Gal. 3, 23.
We were shut vp vnto that Faith, which
afterwards should be
reuealed.

4 A naked knowledge of God, ioyned with an outward
profession of his religion and Faith. Iam. 2, 17,
24. Faith, if it hath no workes is dead. This is
Historicall or Dogmaticall Faith, as Diuines call it.



5 A certaine and sure perswasion of some
wonderous and strange
effects and workes to be done by the power of God. 1.

his merits, as they are promised and offred in the word
& Sacraments. Ro. 1, 17. The iust shall
liue by Faith. Gal. 3. 11, 14. And in al those places
of scripture, where
Righteousnesse, Iustification, life
Eternal, and Saluation,
are attributed to it. This is Iustifying
or sauing Faith, because it enables the elect soule, to
receiue Christs perfect Iustice vnto
Saluation in heauen.
This Faith once had, is neuer vtterly
lost, as Papists fancie.

others without fraud and deceit. Titus 2, 10.
That they may shew all good faith; that is,
Faithfulnesse.

Faith vnto saluation. Yet this properly belongs to
hope, which is a certaine expectation of saluation

Effect.

10 A confidence of obtaining some earthly and bodily
good thing, after a myraculous sort. Actes. 14,
9. When he saw that hee had Faith to bee healed.
This is a passiue miraculous Faith.

liberty which Christians
haue in thinges indifferent. Rom. 14, 1, 22, 23.

Thou hast afflicted mee in

So it is in the Originall.

Faith, or in righteousnesse, and iustly.

14 A Promise, or Vowe. 1. Tim. 5, 12. They
haue forsaken their first Faith. Sée the

inconstancy and vnfaithfulnesse,
indifferently. 1.
Sam. 26, 23. The Lord will rewarde euery man
according to his Righteousnesse and Faith, or
faithfulnesse.

16 Christ, being apprehended by faith. Rom. 9,
32. Also Rom. 3, 28. A man is iustified by
faith. So it is put and taken in the Treatise of
Iustification, wheresoeuer Faith is written without
expresse mention of
Christ.

Iohn 1, 12. Or thus more plainly. That guift,
whereby the beleeuers are firmely perswaded, not onely
that the word of God & all the promises are true,
but do belong to themselues.

first Faith. sig:
The Vow of Baptisme, or Faith of Christianity, which
yong widdowes (who were lasciuious
wantons) did make voyde
by marrying to Infidels;
so, as they renounced Christianity and followed
Satan. Others do expound
this first Faith, of the promise
and fidelity which young Widdowes gaue to the Church, to
do seruice to the poore, which vpon their marriage to

decayed
in credit of her Doctrine and Religion, in

hateth his owne flesh is cruell. Esay 58, 7.
Turne not thy face from thine owne Flesh; that
is, from him which hath a common nature with thee.

4 Consanguinity, or neerenesse of bloud. Rom.
9, 3. My Kinsmen according to the flesh. Rom. 11,
14. If I might prouoke them of my flesh; that is,
my Kindred.

5 The whole man, consisting of body & soule.
Gen. 6, 12, 13. All flesh hath corrupted his
way vpon earth. 1. Pet. 3, 18. Christ
was put to death concerning
the flesh; that is, concerning his manhood, for his
body was dead naturally, and his soule felt the sorrowes
of death spiritually. Acts 2, 24. Luke
3, 6. 1. Pet. 1, 24. Math. 24, 22. And
elsewhere often, is [Flesh] put, to signifie the [whole
humaine Nature.]
Rom. 1, 3. and 8, 5. as it is simply
considered, without
sinfull corruption.

6 Mankind, being weake and feeble, eyther to helpe
himselfe or others. Ier. 17, 15. Cursed bee
he that maketh flesh his arme; that is, which
placeth his strength and safety, in weake and vaine man.



Esay 40, 6. Psal. 78. 39.
Ioell 2, 28. In these, and many other places
[Flesh] doth signifie our whole kind, as it is
wrapt in great imbecility and frailety.

7 The quality of corruption, which is not
sinfull, but the effect
of sinne, accompanying our bodies
in this life. 1 Cor. 15, 50. Flesh and Blood
shall not inherit eternall life, neyther corruption
inherit incorruption;
that is to say, our corruptible bodyes cannot come to
Heauen. That which shall inherit Heauen, must be an
incorrupt Flesh, a body without
corruption.

8 What thing soeuer belonges to this present life. 1
Cor. 7, 18. Such shall haue trouble in the
flesh. Thus Beza expoundeth it. Also it
signifies the estate of this present life. Phil.
1, 24. To abide in the flesh is more needfull for
you.

9 Whatsoeuer is in man, reputed most excellent and
glorious without the grace of Christ; as
Nobility, birth,
wisedome, wit, vnderstanding, reason.
Math. 16, 17. Flesh and Blood hath not reuealed this
vnto thee. Iohn 1, 13, 14. Borne not of Flesh and
Blood. Iohn 3. Phil. 3.

10 All that in Religion, which is outward and to be
seene with the eye, as Morall workes or
ceremonies.
Rom. 4, 1. What hath Abraham gotten according
to the Flesh. This word [Flesh] in the
second verse, is expounded
to be the workes of Abraham,
which did not iustifie him before God. Thus Beza
and Piscator Interpret this place. Sée
Gal. 6, 12. and 33. Where Flesh, signifies the
Ceremonies of
Moyses Law; and whatsoeuer it is which is
without, is noted by this word. Phil. 3, 3.

which is borne of the Flesh is Flesh. Rom. 7, 5.
When we were in the Flesh. Rom. 8, 8.



They that are in the Flesh; That is, in the
corruption

Vnbeleefe, and all motions of the soul which bee euill, all wicked desires, all our
wordes and workes done without grace; how good, holy, or spirituall 
soeuer they seeme to be and shew for; also our learning, doctrine, 
preaching, prayers, and what else soeuer commeth not of 
the spirite of Christ, is called Flesh in the phrase of Scripture.

of sinfull Nature; and in al other places where the word
[Flesh] is applyed to men vnregenerate, it
signifies the whole corruption and naughtinesse of our
Nature, raging and raigning both in the reason and will:
but in those places of Scripture, where [Flesh]
is attributed to new-borne persons, and is set against
the spirit, as in Gal. 5, 17, 19, 24
Rom. 7, 18, 25. In all these (I say) and such
like Texts, the word [Flesh] signifies the
remainder of naturall corruption, euen so much of that
vicious quality of sinne, as still sticketh behind in
regenerate persons,
and is vnmortified. The reason and cause why sinne is
noted out by the name of [Flesh] it is, because
through the Flesh (to wit our Seede) or through carnall
generation, sinne is conueyed into the whole man, Soule
and Body: also, for that the Flesh or Body is the
instrument to execute the lustes of our naturall
concupisence. Rom. 6, 13. Thus Piscator, and
Peter Martir do iudge.
Illiricus
addes another reason; to wit, because man, as he is
sinfull, tendes wholy to carnall thinges. By this we
see, how such are deceiued, who will haue onely the
inferior part of the soule (as will and
affections) meant by
Flesh.

12 Common or ordinary course of nature. Gal. 4, 29.
He that was borne after the Flesh.

13 The Inferiour, or vnreasonable part of the Soule, as
it is corrupt by sinne; to wit, the sinfull will and
affections. Ephe. 2, 3. In fulfilling the
will of the flesh; that is, the desires of our
corrupt will.

14 Euery liuing Creature, reasonable and
vnreasonable.
Psal. 136, 25. Which giueth foode to all
flesh. Gen. 6. and 7. Leu. 17.

15 Authority, dignity, wealth, worship,
corporall conuersation.
2 Cor. 5, 16. We know no man after the flesh.



16 Outward apparance. Iohn 8. Ye iudge
according to the

blessed. Iob 19, 26. And shall see him in my

meat indeede; that is, my selfe being belieued on.
A Sinechdoche.

2 The Man-hood of Christ, as it is
considered apart from
his God-head, or Diuine Nature. Iohn 6, 63.
The Flesh profiteth nothing; that is to say, the
humaine Nature of Christ, is not profitable to vs of it
selfe, but as the God-head dwelleth in it, giuing life to
it, and quickning vs by it. Thus Maister Tindall,
and the Bible-note expound this place. Augustine
and Chrisostom expound it of
vnderstanding the
word Carnally, and not Spiritually.
The former is the better.

destruction of the Flesh sig:

vitall Iuice or moysture

To weaken the strength and power of naturall

merit, & the spirit

godly endeuour stirring vp that Grace. Gal. 5,
24. They that are Christs, haue
crucified the
Flesh. Rom. 8, 12, 13, 14.

Heere this particle [For] noteth the consequent, and
that which followeth, forgiuenesse of sinne; to wit, the
earnest loue of Christ, and doth not note the cause why
her sinnes were forgiuen her, which was her faith in
Christ. Math. 25, 34, 35. Come ye blessed
of my father, For when I was hungry. Heere
likewise, the particle [For] noteth not the cause, but

Pet. 1, 2. Elect according to the
Foreknowledge of God.



Such as seuer Gods will from his

Note.

or do make his fore-knowledge of thinges, the highest
cause of their existence (whereas God fore-knoweth what
things shal be, because he hath first decreed they shall
be) or which will haue foreknowledge
of faith and works, to be causes of
election; they are
deceiued.

thus Forgotten, yet are not so. Psal. 107, 5.
If I Forget thee (ô Ierusalem;)
that is, if I cease to loue thee.

The vncleannesse of vnmarried persons, about
generation. Gal. 5, 19. The workes of the

vnmarried, or howsoeuer. 1. Cor. 6, 9, 18. He
that committeth Fornication, sinneth against his owne
body. This is bodily Fornication.

Sée Math. 5, 32. [Fornication] put

3 Idolatry, or strange worship, which is
spirituall Fornication:
wherein the faith plight with God (as with an husband) to
worship him onely after his owne will, is violated and
broken. Ezek. 16, 15. Thou hast powred out
thy Fornications; and else-where very often, in this
and other Prophets. As Ier. 3, 9. Iudah hath
committed Fornication with stockes and stones.

to Forsake, referred to God. sig:
Not to with-draw his essence or power from his creature
(for they be euery where present) but his grace &
blessing, which is done diuersly, in respect of them whom
he doth forsake. 2. Chro. 15, 2. Ifye Forsake
him, he will Forsake you. This is the general
signification.

2 Wholy and for euer, to take away from men all such
graces as he had giuen them, leauing them
altogether to Satan,
and their owne lust. This is called
a giuing vp, or deliuering vp to vile affections.
Rom. 1, 24, Thus God forsakes wicked men, and
Hippocrites. Thus did he forsake Cain and
Iudas, & Saul. 1. Sa. 16, 14.
The Spirit of the Lord departed
from Saule. 2. Sam. 7, 15, And thus wil
not God forsake his people. 1. Sam. 12, 22.
The Lorde will not Forsake his people for his names
sake.

3 To take away some particular grace, and that for a
time onely. Thus was Dauid forsaken, hauing



lost (after his grieuous sinne) cleannesse of heart,
peace and ioy of conscience, freedome of Spirite,
stablenesse of mind, &c. Psal. 51, 10, &c.

4 To take away the knowledge, feeling, fruit, and
working of his Graces for a season. Thus was
Peter forsaken. Mat. 26. and against
this forsaking,
Dauid prayeth in Psal. 119, 8.
Forsake me not ouer long.

5 To withdraw for a time or for euer, his
blessings and good
successe from our labours, and his temporall protection
from our persons, both our selues and ours. Heb. 13, 5.
I will not faile thee, nor forsake thee. Psalm
22, 1. Why hast thou forsaken me.

6 To withdraw and take away his word, his worship and
ministry. Lam. 2, 7. The Lorde hath forsaken
his Altar; that is, he hath caused his
worship to cease, he hath
taken away his Law, his Prophets,
his Visions, his Sabbaothes, as verse 7, 9. This is
Gods forsaking man.

to Forsake referred to men.

7 To with-draw our heart from God, when wee cease to
put our trust in his promises and
prouidence, and to
obey his Commaundements. Deut. 32, 15.
Israell forsooke the strong GOD that made them.
Psalm. 119, 53. I am affraide of the wicked because
they forsake thy Law. Hebr.
12,
12.
Psalme 119, 118. Heb. 10, 39.

8 To depart from the seruice of the true God, to the
seruice of strange Gods. This is a branch and fruit of the
former forsaking. Iudges 2, 11, 12. They serued Balim,
and forsooke the Lord God of their Fathers. This is
mans forsaking of God.

9 To deny our help and ayde to others in theyr
necessities and dangers. 2 Tim. 4, 16. No Man
assisted me, but all forsooke me. Thus man forsaketh
man.

a forsaking al for christ. sig:
A setled and well grounded purpose and
affection, to leaue
all outward good thinges of this life,



and life it selfe, for the loue of Christ his Gospell;
and to leaue them indeede actually, when
occasion serues.
Luke 14, 33. He that forsaketh not all that
he hath, cannot be my Disciple. Marke 10, 29. Thus
the Christian man forsaketh all; first in affection
& desire, then in effect and deede, if neede bee,
and occasion serue thereunto, as then it doth, when we
cannot hold life and earthly thinges, without denying
Christ and his word.

Fortune. sig:
Chance, when some thinges fals out beside our purpose,
and whereof we can giue no reason. This is called Fortune
or chance: but in respect of God, who knoweth all things,
and ordereth them most wisely to iust and due ends, there
is no chance nor Fortune. Eccle. 9, 11. Time
and Chance commeth to them all. Luke 10, 31. And
it Fortuned, or Chanced.
Christians must beware how they do
commonly vse this word
[Fortune and Chance] in their mouthes,
or attribute ought to it, setting it vp
against Gods prouidence,
which ordereth al things, both good and euill, great and
small. I giue this signification of Fortune, onely to shew
how far it may bee allowed; namely, so farre, as that in
such things (as in regard of our fore-sight happen
accidentally to vs)
wee doe yet acknowledge a diuine prouidence.

themselues) Haters. Rom. 1, 30. Haters of
God.

Hatred. sig:

or Gouernor: the Pope, is so farre from being Head of
the Church, as he is no sound member of the holy
Catholicke, or of the whole Church, being the head of
that Apostacy and falling

his not granting, is his not hearing.

2 To listen vnto the words of God only with the outward

Idoll. sig:
Any Image, or visible representation of false or true
God, though it be not worshipped, nor made with any
intention of worship. 1. Iohn 5, 21. Keep
your selues from Idols. 2. Cor. 6, 16. What
agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols. Deut.
4, 15. Exod. 32,
4. doth manifest the truth of this. For, the Image which
the Iewes made of the true God, is condemned of God
himselfe. Exod. 32, 8. And they that made
it were punished as Idolaters. 1. Cor. 10, 7.
Neither be ye Idolaters, as were some of them, with
whom God was not pleased. 1. Cor. 10, 5.
Finally, in the

only making of an Image of

See Doctor Fulke in his defence of our translations against Greg. Martine. ch: 3.

Diuines both affirme & proue, that both Scriptures
and Fathers, haue in differently vsed the worde Idoll
and Image, for one and the selfe-same thing. Witnesse
that one place of Tertullian
(amongst many) vpon those words of 1. Ioh. 5,
21. Iohn (saith he) doth not write thus
[Keep your selues from Idolatry] that is, from
the seruice of them: but [From Idols;] that is,
from the very Image of



them. It is therefore a dotage in Popery, to
distinguish betweene
Idoll and Image; and to make the picture of a false God
onely, to be an Idoll.

Idoll is nothing.
sig:
The false and faigned Goddes of the Heathen. 1.
Cor. 8, 4. An Idoll is nothing. Gen. 31,
19, 30.

2 An Idoll to be as an empty and vaine Dreame; not in
respect of the matter whereof it is made, for that is
somthing: but in respect of the forme which doth
counterfaite and falsify true things, making them seeme to
be what they are not. Also, in respect of the vaine minde
of the Idolater, who wickedly imagineth some Diuinity to
be in the Idol, whereas
there is but one true God in the world.
Therefore worthily is an
Idoll saide to be nothing, being
a false and lying signe, a very fixion, being
nothing for signification,
though something for substance;
a peece of wood or stone, &c. 1. Cor. 8,
4.

Idolatry. sig:
The worshippe or adoration of an Image, or of God,
before, and by an Image. 1. Cor. 10, 7.
Neither be Idolaters
as they were. Deut. 5, 9. Thou shalt neuer bow to
them, nor serue them.

2 The making of any Image or likenesse of God, or of
any creature, in heauen or earth, for a
Religious end.
Deut. 5, 8. Thou shalt not make to thy selfe
any grauen Image or likenesse, &c. Gal. 5, 20.
Idolatry, Witch-craft. 1. Cor. 6, 9.

3 All

All worship of false Gods, and false worship of the true God, is Idolatrie.

humain inuentions thrust into diuine
seruice. Deut.
12, 32. Whatsoeuer I command you, that do, put
nothing thereto.

4 Setting the heart inordinately vpon any
creature; by fearing,
louing, trusting in it, more then in God, and aboue him.
Thus is Couetousnes called Idolatry. Col. 3, 5.
And wantons make their Belly their God. Phil. 3,
19.

Griefe, for suspition of dishonesty in married

Psal. 79, 5. Shall thy Iealousie burne like
fire?

Jealous. sig:
One, greeued with suspicion of dishonesty in the
married yoak-fellow, with desire of reuenge. Thus are men
Iealous, and thus also is God saide to bee Iealous, when
the marriage betweene him and his Church, is violated and
broken. Deut. 5, 9. For I the Lord thy God am
a Iealous God; that is, so
grieued with Idolatry, as
I study to reuenge it.

2 One, which seemeth to bee much greeued for others,
but it is out of a loue to him-selfe, for his owne
commoditie sake. Gal. 4, 17. They are
Iealous ouer you
amisse. This he writeth of the false
Apostles, who for their
owne gaine and credite did loue the Galathians.
Heere Iealous is taken in euill part.

3 One which loueth others truely, not for lucre and
glory to him-selfe, but for the benefit of the persons
loued. 2. Cor. 11, 2. I am Iealous ouer
you. Thus Paule and all Godly Ministers are
Iealous ouer the Flocke. Heere Iealous is taken in good
part.

Jehouah. sig:

himselfe, from euerlasting; and is the cause of existance

Gods people, and is so in deede, and before God, in spirit
and in heart.

Gentiles. Ioel. 2, 32.


I. G.

Ignorance. sig:
Want of the true knowledge of God, & of
heauenly things.
Ephe. 4, 18. Thorough the Ignorance that is
in them. This ignorance, is either simple, when
meanes of knowledge be wanting: or
willfull and affected,
when one may know & will not. Ignorance being in it
selfe a sinne against the first Commandement, cannot
excuse sin that it should be no fault at all.

2 Vnbeleefe, which followes Ignorance as a Companion or
fruite. 1. Pet. 1, 14. Fashion not your
selues to the former lusts of your Ignorance; that
is, of your blinde vnbeleefe, A Metanimie of the
cause.

3 Error, through want of iudgement, and right deseruing
of things. Leuit. 3, 2. If any man shall sin

ignorance and error, according to the vse of the Hebrew
tongue, which vnder Ignorance, meaneth
euerie sinne, euen that which is witting and willing.
Hebr. 9, 7. And for the Ignorances of the
people. A Sinechdoche of the part for the
whole.

Ignorance may excuse a sinne that it be not so

Note.

great a fault, but it cannot so excuse, as it shalbe no



fault at all. Excusat à tanto, non à

Any shape or portraiture, drawne by Art, to
represent something by
it for ciuill vse, as Caesars

artificiall Image made
for ciuill respects; as to distinguish
Coines, or beautifie Houses, and it is lawfull.

2 Some shape or picture, made to the likenesse of God,
or of some creature for Diuine worships sake.
Exod. 20. 4. Thou shalt make thee no grauen
Image. Deut. 4, 15.

Image of the true God vnlawful, aswel as the Image of a false God.

This is a Diabolicall Image, being made for Religion
sake, and is vnlawfull. Where such Images be, there is
no Religion (saith a Father.) The Scripture saith, that
God spake with a voice, but shewed no Image to his
people of himselfe.



Deut. 4.

3 All mens deuises, commaunded as Gods
seruice. Exod.

the Image and glorie of God. Hitherto of
accidentary
Images.

6 A reall, essentiall, true, and liuely expressing of
the very substance of another. In this
signification, is
Christ saide to be the Image of God his
Father. Col. 1,
15. Heb. 1, 3. Also, the Law is said, not to be the very
Image of the thinges. Hebr. 10. 1. And it is
written of vs, that as wee haue bornethe
Image of the earthly, so we
shall beare the Image of the heauenly man. 1. Cor.
15, 49. And the Reuelation of S. Iohn, speaketh
of the Image of the beast which all men shal adore.
Reuel. 14, 9. In all which
places, is meant the very
things and substances themselues,
or the solid and true existence of the things. These bee
essentiall Images, which haue the
substance of the things
wherof they be called Images.

7 Any manner or resemblance whatsoeuer,
lawfull or vnlawfull;
liuely or painted; true or immaginary.
Gen. 5, 3. He begat a Childe in his own
likenesse, after his
Image. Psal. 73, 20. Thou shalt make their
Image despised. Where the word [Image]
signifieth, an
immaginary vanishing shaddow, to set forth the
lightnesse and vnconstancy of all earthly things, which
seeme and make shew to be the true goodes and felicity
it selfe, yet are nothing but a shaddow or vaine

consubstantiall Image, respecting essence and
substance.

2 Dominion and perfect holinesse. Gen. 1, 27.
In the Image of God created he him. This Image is
accidentall, respecting qualities.

3 Authority and power, which by Gods
ordinance the man hath
ouer his wife. 1. Cor. 11, 7. He is the Image
of God.

Immortall sig: pro
 That which is not capeable of death, or subiect to
dye.

2 An euer-during Nature, which is so of it selfe,

Tim. 1, 17. To God Immortall, onely
wise. Thus is God onely Immortall.

3 That, which being once dead, shall rise again neuer
to die more, as mens bodies. 1. Cor. 15, 53.
Mortality must put on Immortality.

4 That which shall neuer haue end, though it haue a
beginning; as Angels, and mens soules; of which, though it
be not in expresse wordes saide in Scripture, that they be
Immortall, yet inumerable places, by good consequence,
prooue them to be so, as 1. Cor. 15, 19. 2.
Cor. 5, 1. Luke 16, 22, 23, 24,
&c.

Imortality sig:
Such an estate and condition, wherein death hath no

mortall hath put on Immortality, then death shall bee
swallowed vp into victory.

Importunitie.
sig:
Continuance or constancy in Prayer, when we pray and
faint not. Luke 11, 8. Yet doubtlesse,
because of his
Importunitie, hee will giue him what he

18, 2, 3, 4. &c. The poore widdow.

Imposition of hands, or laying on of hands.
sig:
Putting on of hands, which is an ancient
Ceremony vsed of the
Iewes in two cases; one, in consecrating
publicke Sacrifices, as also Priestes and Leuites, to
declare such to be offered to God.
Leuit. 4, 4. And
secondly, in solemne benedictions and Prayers.
Gen. 48, 14, 17, 20. Iacob put his hands vpon
Manasses and Ephraim, and prayed for them. It was
continued vnder the Gospell, by Christ and his Apostles in
time of Prayer, and bestowing
spirituall graces. Also in time of
admitting
Church-Officers; Ministers, & Deacons. Mat.
19, 15. Christ put his handes on little children and
prayed. Acts 6, 6. The Apostles prayed, and laid
their hands on the Deacons. Acts 8, 17, 18. Then
they laid their hands on them & they receiued the
Holy-ghost; and by a Metanimie of the signe,
it dooth signifie the whole Ministry of the Church, and
the order of Church-Gouernment. Heb. 6, 2.
The Doctrine of Baptisme, and Imposition of
hands. Touching the Papists Imposition of hands, in
the Sacrament of Order (as they cal it) there is no ground
for it in the whole Scripture.

Imputation. sig: pro
 Accounting, reckoning, and allowing some thinges to
another of fauour; as Merchants, who do not put the debt
in their reckoning, which they will forgiue.

2 An action of God, freely accounting the
righteousnesse of
Christ to be his righteousnesse, who beleeues in Christ.
Rom. 4, 3, 4. And it was
Imputed (or
counted) to him for righteousnesse. In this
fourth Chapter to the Romans, this word
[Imputed] (derided by Popish Heretickes) is
seauen times repeated
in the Doctrine of Iustification, and is
ioyned vnto faith;
without which, there is no Imputation
of Christs Iustice to vs. Rom. 4, 23, 24. Our



sins and punishment were Imputed to Christ (who

Note.

bare our sins in his body, and was made sinne for vs. 1
Pet. 2. verse last.) And his righteousnesse
with the merit thereof (euen eternall blisse) is imputed
and accounted to al beleeuers; whence ariseth
Iustification of a
Sinner before God. 2. Cor. 5. verse last.
He that knew no sinne, was made sin for vs, that we
might be made the righteousnesse of God in him: Not
our righteousnesse, but the righteousnesse of God; not
in vs, but in him (saith an ancient father.) The
Papists, scoffing at this most necessary and
deuine action, of
Imputing righteousnesse to faith, apprehending Christ,
calling it in their Notes printed
at Rhemes, a new-no-Iustice, an vntrue
Imputation, an
immaginary thing, a putatiue righteousnesse,
a fantastical apprehension. In these and such like
taunts, they vtter so many blasphemies against Heauen,
and all to maintaine and establish their owne
righteousnesse of workes.

2 To absolue & acquit a sinner, which beleeues, from
the guilt and punishment of all his sins, and to
pronounce him righteous before the tribunal seat of God,
through the Imputation of Christs
righteousnesse to
his faith. In this sence, we are said to be Iustifyed by
faith, and not by workes. Rom. 3, 28.
Therefore wee conclude, a man is Iustified by faith,
without workes of the Law. And often else-where,



both in that Epistle and others, [Iustifying]
is put for our [Absoluing] from sin, and being
pronounced Iust
before God his Iudgement seat. Sée Acts

abhominations. Ier. 3, 6.

6 To be more iust, or lesse vniust. Ier. 3,

7 To exempt one, and to make him vtterly and wholy free

that is Iust, let him be still iustified. Thus it is
read in the Originall Greeke Text.

In all the Old-Testament, it cannot bee found,

Note.

that the word which signifieth [Iustifying] is
euer

Against the Papists.

vsed in the Originall Haebrew tongue, otherwise then for
[Absoluing] a person accused. Neither in the
New-Testament (when our [Iustification]

hath it any other meaning; and neuer found (in this
Argument) to signifie; of euill and vniust, to make one
iust and good.

Iustified by his grace. In this signification, we
find the word [Iustifying] vsed. Rom. 8,
30. Whom hee called, them he Iustified. Heere
Iustification is vsed largely, for Sanctification
also.

What Iustification is.

Iustification, is an action of God, freely, of his
owne mercy and fauour, absoluing a beleeuing
sinner, from the whole
curse due to his sinnes, and accounting
him perfectly Iust in his sight, vnto
eternall life in
heauen, through the perfect obedience and sufferings of
Christ Imputed to his faith, vnto the euer-lasting
praise and glory of Gods Iustice, mercy, and truth.

The efficient cause of Iustification, is, the grace of

God; The material, is Christ our Redeemer; The
formall, is Imputation; The helping Instrumentall
cause, is, Faith within, and the Gospell without; The
finall cause, is, Gods glory; The vtmost, and our
saluation, the neerest end thereof.

Iustification before God, is not knowne in all

Liberty begun and vnperfit; beeing bought for vs by the
price of Christs blood, and reuealed vnto vs by the
Gospell.

3 A full and perfect deliuerance, from the very



corruption of Sinne, and of the Graue too, and from all
misery whatsoeuer. Ephe. 1, 14. Which is the
Redemption of that Liberty purchased vnto the praise of
his Glory. This is the accomplishment of the former
Liberty. It is called [Glorious Libertie.] Rom.
8, 21. Because the Saints being once freed from all
miseries, shall be glorified in Heauen.

4 That condition of Gods Children, from whom the vaile
of the heart is taken away, and that yoake of darknesse
(which by the sin of one man beeing put vppon vs) was made
more heauy by another yoake of Moyses Law,
encreasing and strengthening
naturall blindnesse in vs before conuersion. 2 Cor. 3, 17.
Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is
Liberty. 1 Pet. 2, 16.

5 A freedome or power, which is giuen vnto the

Edification. Rom. 14, 19. Here of the Apostle entreateth.
Rom. 14. throughout.
Also 1 Cor. 6, and 8. and 1 Cor. 10.

Christian Liberty, what it is?

Christian liberty, is a spirituall benefit
purchased by the death
of Christ, to the setting free of the faithfull which
beleeue in Christ, not onely from the

1 Cor. 7, 23.

preceptes and traditions of men, as
binding the conscience,
and

1 Cor 9. 19. Gal 5, 1. Rom 8, 1.

from the yoake of the whole Ceremoniall Law of
Moyses; but also from

Rom. 7, 4, 5. Also Rom. 5, 15. 16, 17, 18

the curse and rigorous exaction of the Morall Law, euen
from the whole wrath of God, due to our Sins, by the
Iustification of Faith; and finally,

Rom 6, 13, 14, 15.

from the dominion and raigne of sinne, by the
Sanctification of the Spirit: That ye may

Luke 1, 74.

serue and obey the will of God without all terrour and
slauish feare, in all quiet tranquility of minde, and
cheerefulnesse of Conscience, vnder sure hope of
eternall glory. Therefore they are much deceiued,



whosoeuer thinke Christian Liberty to consist in
freedome of the doctrine and obedience of the Morall
Law, or from the yoake of any lawfull
authority, ciuill, or
ecclesiasticall, that men may liue licentiously as
themselues list, vsing their liberty as a cloake of
wickednesse.

might begin to thinke, speake, and doe in some measure,

Abrahams Lye. Gene. 12,
12.
And the Lie of Gehesa. 2 Kings 5, 25.
This is a ciuill
Lye in mens matters; and it is eyther sportfull, and in
iest, or hurtfull, and dangerous, or officious, being
made in fauour of others, for their help and benefit:
This last kinde, howsoeuer it carry a shew of honestie
& charity, because it is beneficiall to our
Neighbour; yet, indeede and truth, it is euill and
damnable; because it is
against the commaundement which
forbiddeth
Lying and hath appearance of euill. Also, Charity
reioyceth in the truth, and not in

3 To obtaine and get a thing. Thus the fathers often
vse this word in their writings: and thus, all Christians

cannot merit it by desert.

obtaine them, through the alone
mediation of Christ, to the praise of the
mercy, trueth, and power
of God. Prayer, is eyther priuate, or publicke; for our
selues, or others; for the hauing of good things, or
remoouing thinges euill. Whence ariseth the difference,
and diuers kinds of Prayers, mentioned 1. Tim.
2, 2. Let supplications
and Prayers, Intercession and giuing of Thankes, be made
for all men.

to preach. sig:
To declare the will of God by voice, for the
instruction of the
Church. Marke 1, 49. He Preached in their
Synagogues.



what Preaching is.

Preaching, is an action of the Minister of the word,
soundly interpreting and opening the sence of the
Scriptures, by the Scriptures; with
application of them
vnto the vse of the Church, by Doctrin,
Exhortation, reprofe, conuincing & comfort.
Mar. 2, 2. He Preached the word to
them. Lu. 4, 18, 19, 20, 21. He tooke vp the
booke, and read, and said; this day is this Scripture
fulfilled in your eares. Also, 1 Cor. 14,
3. He that professeth (that is, Preacheth)
speaketh to men, to edifying, to exhortation, to
comfort.
Sée Nehe. 8, 8. And he reade in the
booke of the Law,

Thus Tremelius translates it out of the Hebrwes

and gaue the sence according to
Scripture.
Acts. 9. 20, 22. Hee Preached Christ

Thus Maister Beza reads, and expounds it according to the greeke.

confirming that
Iesus was this Christ (that is to say.) Hee
compared Scripture with Scripture, conferring them
together, as cunning Craftsmen which ioyne all partes
together, to make them agree one with another. This is
Preaching in the ordinary phrase of the Scriptue. Indeed
euery declaration of Gods wil, eyther by afflictions,
blessings, readings, and creatures; or otherwise, may
generally and improperly
be called Preaching.

lumpe of lost mankind, a certaine number, to obtaine
eternal life in heauen, by Christ (hauing first called,
Iustified, and Sanctified them) vnto the praise of his
glorious grace. Rom. 8. 28, 29, 30.



Eph. 1. 5, 6, 7.

Predestination, is the most wise purpose of God,

Predestination what it is, according to Peter Martyr.

whereby he hath before all eternity, constantly
decreed, to call those
whom hee hath loued in Christ, to the adoption of his
children, to Iustification by Faith, & at the length

of the Law, and old Testament; Legall and Leuiticall
Priests.

2 A Sacrificing person especially ordained of God, that
by the Sacrifice of himselfe, once offered by himselfe;
and also, by his intercession, he might reconcile vnto,
and keepe in fauour with God, for euer, all beleeuing
sinners. Such a Priest is Christ onely, being the alone
Priest of the New-Testament,



propperly so called. Heb. 7, 17. Thou art a
Priest for euer after the order of Melchizedek.
Also verse 23. 24, 25, &c. See Chapter 10. from

in a speciall manner, was a figure of Christ, both in his

eminent place, Christ being
chiefe among the Pastours, as Aaron was
among the Priests.
Heb. 5, 1, 2, 3. vnto the 10. verse. For euery
High-Priest is taken from among men. 1 Pet. 2,
25.

The difference, betweene a Priest properly, and

Note this.

improperly taken, is this. The former hath an
externall and bodily
Sacrifice, to giue and offer vnto God, as Christ did
giue his owne body; and the Priest of the Law, the
bodies of beasts. The latter,



offereth spirituall Sacrifices only; as their Prayers,
praise, obedience, almes, and all other
Goodworkes and duties
of their callings, which euerie Christian (as well as a
Minister) is bound to offer. The popish Priest-hood is
an immaginary & blasphemous
fixion, hauing no grounde, neither any colour and shew
of ground and proofe, in the whole Booke of God.

&c.

Such an one is Christ, and he onely. Esay. 9, 6.
Prince of Peace.

Profession. sig:
An action of a Christian, plainly and openly
declaring and vttering
with his mouth, that which he beleeueth and hopeth in his
heart, concerning Christ and saluation by him. 1
Tim. 6, 12. And hast professed a good
Profession, before many witnesses. There may be a
profession made before men, with the mouth, when the truth
of it is not to be found in the heart, before God.
Tit. 1 16. They Professed
to know God, when in their works they denied him.

Iacob for giuing his Daughter: Saul to
Dauid: Dauid to

which wee will doe vnto his honour. Psalme 66,
13, 14. I will pay thee my vowes which my lippes haue
promised. Numbers. 30, 3. Hee shall not breake
his Promise. This is a religious or
holy Promise, called a Vowe
in Scripture. Sée Vow.

3 The word of God, giuen or plighted vnto men, for the
performance of some good, or for
remouing some euill,
spiritually or bodily. Psal. 119. 130. How sweet are
thy promises to my mouth? And ver. 49. 50.
38. This is a diuine promise. Which is two fold: Legall
and Euangelicall.

Gods Promise is two-folde: first Legall, when

Note this.

hee passeth his word for the giuing of eternall life,
and other temporall good thinges, vpon condition of
fulfilling the lawe. Leuit. 18, 5.
Ephe. 6, 1. This is the first commandement
with Promise. Gala. 3. 12. Doe this and
liue. Secondly Euangelicall; when he passeth his
worde for the giuing of Christ, and
together with him,
remission of sinnes, righteousnes, and eternal life, as
also the blessings of this life,
vpon condition of beleeuing
the Gospell. Rom. 1. 2. Which he promised
before by his Prophets. And Rom. 4,
16.
That the Promise might be sure to all the seed:
That is, to such as walke in the steps of Abrahams
faith. Galat. 3, 14. That wee might receiue
the Promise of the
spirit through faith. This latter promise, is
called the Promise of grace, because it is freely giuen,
and freely performed. Also Galat. 3, 14. It is
called the Promise of the spirit, because the spirit is
both the authour and applier of it. More ouer the
thinges Promised, come from the spirit. This
Promise is also called
the worde of faith. Rom. 10, 8. Because the
worde of this Promise, is made with



condition of faith, which is the only instrument to
apprehend and receiue it. Lastly, it is termed the
Promise of Christ, because he is the terme and end of
it.

Prophane. sig:
An vnholy person which refuseth heauenly things, for
enioying of earthly. As Esau cast away his
Birth-right for a messe of pottage, and

person for his labour.

penmen of the holy

Note this.

Diuines, for Sanctification and Renouation; and then it
imports and signifies as much, as the
reformation of a
Man; which consists in the Mortification
of sinne, and newnesse of life. Whereas, if we speake
exactly, and as the thing is, this renewing of our
Nature, is but an effect and fruit of our
Regeneration,
which properly is, our incorporation and ingrafting into
Christ by Faith, whereby wee haue our spirituall being

and Daughters of God. Iames 1, 18. Of his owne will
begat he vs by the word of truth. Titus 3, 4, 5, 6.
Therefore, the confounding of Regeneration,
with Sanctification, I doe take to bee an ouer-sight: but

any stroke in our Newbirth;
so much as to assent to it; til of vnwilling, we be made
willing.

for, and comforted. If we speake properly, there fals into
God no forgetfulnesse,
but as men vse to helpe such as they
remember and think vpon;

shewes and makes it knowne, that he

righteous and iust of his word. Psal. 24, 5.
Hee shall receiue Righteousnesse from the God of his
saluation.

5 The perfect conformity of Christ, his human Nature
and life vnto the will of his Father, which is called the
Righteousnesse of Christ, because it was in him as the
proper subiect, and the Righteousnesse
of Faith; because faith is the only
instrument to apprehend
it, and receiue it; & the Righteousnesse
of God, because it can onely satisfie and answere the
rigour of Gods Righteous Law. Rom. 3, 21, 22. The
Righteousnesse of God, is manifest
without the Law, and it is our Iustification
before God.

6 The thorough conformity and agreement (in some part
and measure) of our will & actions, vnto the whole
iust Law of God. Rom. 6, 18, 19. Being free
from sin, ye are made the seruants of
Righteousnesse.
&c.

7 That iust and vpright dealing which is
betweene man and man.

Christ (as King) can giue to his chiefe

Woman that made this request, did thinke Christ to be an
earthly King; and therefore, desired
for her sonnes (not a Tyranicall Gouernment, which had
beene vnnaturall for her to aske; vnfit for Christ to
giue; and vnprofitable for her sonnes to receiue) but the
highest lawfull dignities vnder Christ: such as
Ioseph had vnder Pharaoh in
Egypt; and Daniell, vnder
Darius in Babylon. It is a fault in the
Rhemists, who thinke Heathenish Tyrannic
forbidden heere, which the other Apostles would haue
pittied, not disdained. Mark 10, 41.

2 The cheefest glory and blisse in the kingdom of
heauen. Math. 20, 23. To sit on my Right
hand, and on my left, shall be giuen to them, for whome
it is prepared of my Father. These words teach
plainly, two things:
First, that there shall be differences

prepared and appointed of God, in his aeternall purpose.

18, 1. Thou art my Rocke; that is, succour and
defence.

3 Christ Iesus, who is called a Rocke, in two respects.
First, because wee haue from him our soule-refreshing;
as water gusht out of the Wildernesse,
to refresh the people being thirsty. 1 Cor. 10,
1. The Rocke that followed them, was Christ.
Secondly,



because hee alone strongly sustaines and beares vp his
Church, built vppon him by faith; as a house vpon a
Rocke. Math. 16, 18. Upon this Rocke will I
build my Church. The Papists, which expound this,
not of Christ beleeued on, and confessed
by Peter, but of the person of Peter:
they deale reprochfully with Christ, by lifting the
creature and seruant of
Christ, into the roome & place of his Creator &
Lord. Also falsely with the Text, which saieth, not
[vpon this Peter,] but [vpon this
Rocke] that is; not vpon thee Peter, but
vppon my selfe (as Augustine expounds it.)
Lastly, they offer wrong, and deale iniuriously with the
Church, to build it vpon so feeble, fraile, and weake a
Rocke as Peter; who failed more often then any
of his fellow Apostles, (Iudas
excepted.)

Scriptures



are called Cannonicall; because they containe
and giue a perfect Rule of faith and manners vnto the

running; that is to our outward
endeuours, by outward actions, labors,

voluntarily worship God, by offering some
outward thing vnto his

after some benefit. Psalm 50, 8. I will not repoooue
thee for thy Sacrifices. And 51, 16. Leuit. 31. And

glorification in Heauen. Here of there are two degrees;
the first is, at the time of our death, when the Soule
being losed from the bodie, is carried by elect Angels
into the third Heauens. Luke 16, 22. The second degree is,
at the day of the Resurrection,
when our whole person, body, and Soule, shal be receiued
vp into Heauen with Christ, into
euerlasting blisse.

Whatsoeuer belonges to faith or manners, is sufficiently taught in Holy Cannonicall

Groat. Luke 15, 8.

earnest desire of hauing some excellent &
needfull



grace, which is absent and wanting to him,
either in whole or in
part; in substance, or in degree. Thus wee are commanded
to Seeke the Kingdome of Heauen. Math. 6, 33.
to Seeke Wisedome. Prou. 2, 4. to Seeke God
and his face. Psal. 27, 8.

as Prayer, reading, hearing, &c.
Fourthly, constancy
till we find. Fiftly, a loue of the thing found. Sixtly,
care to keepe, & loathnesse to loose it. This whole
action, is shaddowed in the example
of Mary, in seeking vp of Iesus. Luke
2, 44, 45, &c.

First, that wee are either lost (as all are before

Seeking referred to God, doth imply & contain vnder it, these fiue seuerall things.

their conuersion) or stragled from him (as euery
conuerted person is more, or lesse; at one time or
other.) Luke 19, 10. Luke 15, 3, 4,
&c.

2 A desire and care in God, to recouer vs, and to bring
vs backe to himselfe (as an Hen is careful to gather her
Chickings.) Math. 23, 37. How often
&c.

3 The offering and continuing vnto vs means, that he
may finde vs; to wit, his Word, Ministers, blessings,
corrections, motions of his spirit, checks of our
Conscience, admonitions of the godly: By all which, we are
sought vp and called to him, as thorough the whole
Scripture manifestly appeareth.



4 His great loue towardes vs, being found and recouered.
This is expressed, in the father of the lost sonne.
Luke 15, 22.

5 Lastly, care to keepe vs still, with
vnwillingnesse to
loose vs again. Iohn 10, 28. None shal take
them out of my hands. All these things are
shaddowed out vnto vs,
in him that fought his lost sheepe. Luke 15, 2,
3, 4, 5, &c.

Seeking (as it is affirmed of Hypocrites &
wicked

Note.

men) is nothing else, but the making of a shew, as if
they felt a want of God, and his good guifts, and were
desirous to find them, when in truth they seeke not him,
for him-selfe, but for some other thing, as their owne
case and commodities, &c. Or they Seeke other things
more then him, or before
him, as worldlings; or Seeke him amisse, not in his
word, as Heretickes; or not in all his word, as
Hypocrites Seeke him: or lastly, they Seek him too late,
when he is not to bee found; as the fiue foolish Virgins
did, and all secure Christians doo. Of these, and such
like Seekers it is written. Prou. 1, 20.
They shall Seeke mee earely, and shall not finde
me.

to Seeke God. sig:

of perpetuall Chastity in single life, of wilfull

they are vnlawful, as not being in our owne power, nor

falsely call their Romish Idolatrous Religion.

V. S.

Usury. sig.

Biting, (in the Haebrewe tongue) because the gaine which
is taken fot Money or Wares, in
respect of lending, doth
gnaw, bite, and wring him that giueth it; especially if
he be a poore man, and bringeth home a bit or morsell
from the rich man.



Psal. 15, 5. He that lendeth his Money vpon
Vsurie.

Note.

The worde [Vsury] is neuer vsed in good sence
or part by the Scripture; where also no Vsurie is to be
found but one; to wit, a biting and gnawing
Vsury, which is neuer
practised without hurt, either to rich or poore; to
priuate personnes, or publicke weale.

What Vsury is.

Vsury, is any encrease or vantage, for lone of Money,
or other things, imposed or layde by the lender vpon the
borrower onely, in consideration of the lending. Ezek. 18,
5, 6. Deut. 13, 19, 20. Or more breefely thus:
Vsury, is a certaine gaine aboue the principall, exacted
vppon Couenant for the vse of money, or other things lent.
Exod. 22, 25. Thou shalt not impose Vsury vpon
him. Thus it is in the Haebrew Text.

Fiue things belonging to Vsury.

Vnto Vsurie these fiue things are necessarily
required. 1. A
principall, as wares, or sum of money. 2. Lending. 3.
Gaine. 4. A chiefe purpose by lending
to encrease our stocke. 5. a Couenant for that end.

As the verie desire and expectation of gaine, for
lending onely, is mentall and intentionall Vsurie:

Note.

so the imposing, or by Couenant before hand,
agreeing for encrease
aboue the principall, is of the Nature of actuall Vsury.

In all these three cases, there is no Imposition of
encrease, that is, no
fore-Couenant, binding absolutely
the borrower to pay gaine with the stocke.

There are three cases wherein encrease may bee

Note.

taken by a lender without danger of Vsury. First, when
the borrower hauing by lawfull meanes, made some great
gaine by money freely lent, doth



by way of Thankefulnesse, out of the voluntary
motion of his owne heart,
returne some-thing aboue the principall vnto the lender,
by whose means he had such a blessing.

2 When it may be duly and apparantly proued, without
pretence and collusion, that the borrower by holding backe
the money lent him after the day agreed vpon for paiment,
without the leaue of the lender, doth become heereby a
direct and effectual cause of hinderance to the Lender,
either by damage arising to
him, or by fore-going some commoditie
which he might well haue made with his money, had it come
home at the appointed time.

3 When the Lender is content to hazard the principall,
and to beare part of the losse, if any fal to the
borrower, without his owne default. Heere he lawfully may
take part of the gain which commeth by good meanes.
