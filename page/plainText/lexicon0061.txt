Vrine is the superfluitie or

hollow vayne, conueyed by the renes &
water pypes into the bladder.







Thexposytion of certayne wordes.


NOw for bicause I was enforced
to vse sum (though but few) ter­
mes in this boke, which be not well
knowen of the most sorte of men, though
a great nomber know them well ynough
by often talking with Physitions, I thought
it good here to declare sum certayne of
them, for the ayde of the most simple sort.






Ages.
Bicause that in the iudgement of v­
rynes, the differences of ages ought to 
be consyderyd, you shall vnderstand that
the cheife differences of them are .iiij.
that is to saye: Chyldehod, Youthe,
Manhod, & Olde age / for though thr




be comonely. vij. Ages rekened, yet these
be the .iiij. principall, & thother .iij. be
comprehended vnder these .iiij. 

Childehod

Chyldehod
endureth from thower of byrth, vntyl
thende of .xiiij. yeres of age, & is of com­
plexion hotte & moist.

youth

At thende of .xiiij.
yeres begynneth youth, and lastyth tyl
the .xxv. yeare / and thys age of all
other, is in complexion the most tempe­
ratest, From .xxv. yeres, vntyll .xxxv.
yeres, is the flourishyng of manhod: 

Headword in marginal note.



Manhod

but
yet that manhod lasteth (though not in 
full freshnesse) vntyll .l. yeres of age / &
this age is of complexion hotte & drye.

Headword in marginal note.



Age

From .l. yeres forwarde, is the tyme of 
age peculyerly called / in whiche tyme
mannes nature is colde & drye, and not
moyst: as menny do falsely thynke.

Brightnes.

Brightnesse in vryn must be marked
for a seuerall thing from clearenesse. for
the brightnes betokeneth the orientnes,
& the bewty of the colour. with a certayne
glisteryng. 

Headword in marginal note.



Clearenes,

And clearenesse is referred
to the substaunce of vryn, & is euer an­
nexed with thynnesse of it. Yet is it a dy­




uerse qualitie from thynnes. So may
an vryne be cleare in substaunce, by the 
reason of his thynnes / & yet not bright
in colour: & contrary wayes may an v­
ryne be bright in colour, & not clere in
substaunce / but this wold be well pon­
derid, lest this necessari distinction cause
an negligent confusion.

Headword in marginal note.



 Crytical
dayes.

Criticall dayes be soche dayes, on
which there is (or may be) perceyued
sum certayn token & great alteration in
the sycke body, other to helth or death,
or continuaunce of syckenes. What these
be, more at large I wyl hereafter (God
willyng) declare in a booke peculyerly,
bicause it requireth more largenesse of
wordes, then is meete for this place.

Headword in marginal note.



Iudicial
dayes

But one thing I must tel you, that the
same daies also be called Iudiciall / but
not Indiciall: for the Indiciall dayes
are of an other kynde, but yet associate 
to these other.

Headword in marginal note.



Crudite

Crudite is the rawnesse of the meate
in the stomake, when the natural opera­
tion of it, can not duly disgest the meate
which it hath receyued: & therfore, the
vrine which declareth defaulte of soche




digestion, is called a crude, raw, & vncon­
cocte vryne.

Cloddy
vryne

A cloddy vryne is that which hath
in it cloddes of blood, or other crude
mater, or any clusterynges of difforme
contentes. 

Headword in marginal note.



Darke
grounde.

Darke grounde is not ment
of the darkenesse of colour, but rather
of the slendernesse of substance, so that it
can scarcelye be dyscerned to be anye
grounde, by reason that hit is so neare
in shape & substaunce to the rest of the 
vryne. 

Headword in marginal note.



Dulnes,

Dulnesse of colour, is contrary
to brightnesse: so that when the colour
lacketh all brightnesse, then is it clene
dullyd. and what so euer thyng causeth
decay of soch brightnesse, that thyng
dullyth vryne. 

Headword in marginal note.



Dyuerse.

Those Contentys be
called diuerse, which haue nother their
owne ryght forme, nother any other
certen / but at all together dysorderyd
and out of forme / rather semynge to 
be menny, then to be one.

Duly knyt

Duly knytte, is a property of dew con­
tentes, when they are nott tatteryd,
raggyd, nor iaggyd, nor flytterynge a 
sunder: nor yet ar not so clammyd to­
gether, as towgh fleme, or anye lyke

betwene both these.

Inequalyte

Inequalyte of substaunce in vrin, doth
appere to be the difformenes & disagreing
of the partes of it together: as when it
is thin in one parte, & thicke in a nother.
Howbeit, it is as well vsed for the altera­
tion from a meane substaunce to thicknes
or thynnes, or other ways vnnatural.

Headword in marginal note.



Obstruction

Obstruction, is a stoppynge, com­
menly of the vaynes and soche great
cundytes (whiche conuaye bloodd or
any other humoure) so that the thyng
whiche they shulde conuaye, can not
frely passe, as hyt ought. 

Headword in marginal note.



Oppilation

But if the 
lyke stoppynge happen in the pores
of the skynne, (I meane those vn­
sensyble holes, by whiche sweate pas­
syth out) so that nother swete, nor any
lyke excrement may passe that wayes,
then is hyt moast named Oppilation.




Howbeit, as these wordes be sumtymes
vsed the one for the other, so they be ap­
plyed also to other sundry partes of the 
body: but euermore thei betoken soche
stoppinge in that parte, that natures
worke is hindered therby.

Qualytyes

Qualyties actyue, are named heate
and colde, bicause they ar more apte &
able to worke, then to be wrought. And
contrary wayes, drynes & moysture ar
named passyue, or sufferyng qualyties,
bicause they ar more redy to be alteryd
by the workynge of heate and colde,
then to worke themselfes: how be it,
yet they do worke also.

The .4.
tymes of 
sicknes

There be in sickenes .iiij. principall
partes of tyme to be obserued of Phy­
sitians: The begynnyng of sycknes,
the increase or augmentyng, the stan­
dyng or cheife force of it: & the declina­
tion or asswagyng of it. 

Headword in marginal note.







The begin­
nynge

The beginnynge, is from the tyme
that syckenes hath ouer cum mannes
strengthe, & brought him to lye down,
tyll there be appere manifest sygnes of 
concoction of the mater, whereof the 
disease cummeth / at whiche tyme the 
syckenes waxeth fearcer & fearcer: 

Headword in marginal note.



The encrese

and
whyle it so continuyth, that tyme is cal­
led the increase & augmenting of sicke­
nesse: 

Headword in marginal note.



The state

but when the violence of the sick­
nesse is at the most, so that the rage of 
it is at one stay, & nother incraseth nor
decreaseth / that time is called the stan­
ding stay, state, or cheife strengthe of the
syckenesse. 

Headword in marginal note.



Declination

And after that the furyous
rage of syckenes doth abate and calme
his cruell stormes, then is the declina­
cion of the syckenesse: after which (if
the pacient escape, as very few dye in
the declination) then followeth recouerye
to health againe, And these be the .iiij.
generall or vniversall tymes of sicknes.
Besides these ther be other tymes more
particuler, wherof now to speke I nede
not.

Tymes of

The diuersytie of tymes in the yere
ar duly to be obserued / for thei do moch

The springe

The Spring time encreaseth blood
and bringeth al the partes of the body
to a temperaunce, as nygh as hit can.
For hit of all other tymes is the most
temperate: nother excessiuely hotte, nor
colde: nother moyst, nor drye. but of a 
iust temperature, as Galen proueth a­
bundantly in his first boke of temperament:
where he doth moche blame them that
name hyt to be hotte & moyst, whiche
(he sayth) is of all other the most pe­
stilent state of ayer. This spryng, after
Galenes mynde, doth begynne aboute
the .x. day of Marche, & endeth aboute
the .xxiiij. daye of Apryll: so that it la­
styth but .vj. wekes & .ij. dayes.

Summer

For at 
the risyng of the Pleiades (whiche is
now in our tyme, about the .xxiiij. day
of Apryll) he sayth that summer doth
begynne. which summer is in complexion
hotte and dry, & therefore meete to en­
crease choler, which in that tyme doth
abounde. The sommer lastyth .xxj. we­
kes: 

Headword in marginal note.



Haruest

Haruest doth begynne, after Ga­
lenes mynde, aboute the .xvij. daye of 
September, and lastyth .vij. wekes.
The Haruest, is drye of complexion,




but nother oneli hotte, nor onely colde,
but is distemperate in heate and colde.
For in the mornyng & euenyng, hit is
colde, & at noone it is hotte. so may it
not be called iustly ( as moast men doo
name it) colde and drye. In this tyme
doth melancholy encrease. 

Headword in marginal note.



Wynter

At the ende
of Haruest, about the .vij. day of No­
uember doth Wynter begynne. which
tyme is colde and moyst, and therfore
encreaseth fleme, which is lyke in com­
plexion vnto hit. and the Wynter la­
styth tyll the .x. day of Marche: so is it
in length, about .xvij. wekes & a half: &
then beginneth the Spring tyme again.
And this is the course of the yere, after
Physicke. 

Headword in marginal note.



An other
sort of these
tymes.

Other men which entreate 
of husbandrye, do parte the yeare into
iiij. equall partes, geuing .iij. monithys
to euery tyme. Vnto the Spring, they
geue February, Marche, and Apryll.
to the Summer, May, Iune, & Iuly.
vnto Haruest, August, September, Octo­
ber. & vnto Winter, they appoynt, No­
uember, December & Ianuary. Why the 
Physitions parte the yeare one ways, &
wryters of husbandry anotherways, at
more conuenient tyme I wyll declare.
