¶ Abatement of a writ 
or plaint,
ABatement of a 
writ or plaint, 
is when an acti­
on is brought by writ 
or plaint, wherein is 
lack of sufficient & good 
matter, or els the mat­
ter alleaged, is not cer­
teinly set downe, or if 
the plaintife or defen­
dant, or place, are misna­
med, or of ther appeare 
variance betwene the 
writ and the specialty, 
or recorde, or that the 
writ or the declaration 
be vncerten, or for death 
of the plaintif or defen­
dant, & for diuers other 
lyke causes which I 
omyt of purpose, for 
thereof alone, a man 
might make a large dis­
course, and I determin 
to satisfie you (good 
Brother Nicholas) as 
wel as I may, with as 
much breuitie, and as 
litle trouble to my self 

 

as I can, then vppon 
those defaults, the de­
fendant may pray that 
the writte or plaint 
may abate, that is to 
say, that the plaintife 
suit against him may 
cease for that time, and 
that he shall begyn a­
gaine his suit, & bring 
a new writ or plaint 
if he bee so dysposed 
to do.
 
¶ Abatement in landes.
ABatement in lands 
or tenementes, is 
when a man dyeth 
seised of landes or te­
nementes, and a stran­
ger, that is to say, one 
that hath no right en­
treth into the same 
landes or tenementes, 
before the heir maketh 
his entrie, this entrie 
of the stranger is called 
an abatement, & he an 
abatour. But if the 
heire enter first after the
death of his auncestor, 

 

and the straunger en­
ter vpon the possession 
of the heire, this en­
trie of the straunger, 
is a disseisine to the 
heire.
 
¶ Abbot.
ABbot, was the so­
ueraigne head or 
chief of those hou­
ses of Popish Reli­
gion, whiche when 
they stoode were cal­
led Abbeis, and this 
Abbot together wyth 
the Monkes of the 
same house, who were 
called the Couent, 
made a corporation.
 
¶ Abbettors.
ABbettors are in di­
uers cases diuersly 
taken, one kind of ab­
bettors are they that 
maliciouslye without 
iust cause or desert do 
procure other to sue 
fals appeals of murder 

 

or felony, against men, 
to the entent to trouble 
and greue them, and to 
brynge them into in­
famye and sclaunder. 
Abbettors in murder, 
are those that com­
maund, procure, coun­
sell, or comfort others 
to murder. And in 
some case, such abbet­
tors shall bee taken as 
principals, and in some 
case but as Accessories 
So in other felonies. 
And theyr presence at 
the deede doing, & theyr 
absence, maketh a diffe­
rence in the case. There 
are abbettors also in 
Treason, but they are 
in case as principalls, 
for in Treason there 
are no accessories.
 
¶ Abeiance.
ABeyance is when 
a leas is made for 
terme of life, the re­
maynder to the right 
heires of I. S. which 

 

I.S. is lyuing at the 
tyme of the graunt: 
Now this graunt of 
remainder passeth from 
the grauntor present­
lye, yet it vesteth not 
presently, nor taketh 
holde in the grauntee, 
that is to say, the right 
heire of I. S. but is 
said to be in Abeiance, 
or as the Logyciens 
terme it in power, or 
in vnderstanding, and 
as we say in the clouds. 
That is to witte, in 
the consideration of the 
lawe. That if I. S. 
dye, leauing a ryght 
heire lyuing, and ly­
uing the lessee for lyfe, 
then this is a good re­
mainder, and now ves­
teth and commeth into 
that right heyre, in 
such sort, as that hee 
may graunt, forfait, or 
otherwise dyspose the 
same, and ceaseth to be 
any more in abeyance, 
for that there is one now 
of abilitye to take it 

 

because that I. S. is 
dead, and hath left a 
right heire in lyfe, 
which coulde not bee 
lyuing I.S. for that 
duringe his life, none 
could properly be said 
his heire. Also if a man
be patron of a church, 
and presenteth one to 
the same: Now is the 
fee in the person, but if 
the person dye, and the 
church is become void, 
then is the fee in abey­
ance, vntill there bee a 
new person presented, 
for the patron hath 
not the fee, but onely 
the right to present, 
and the fee is in the in­
cumbent that is pre­
sented, and after hys 
death, it is in no body 
but in abeyance tyll 
there bee a new in­
cumbent, as is afore­
saide.
 
¶ Abishersing.

 

ABishersing (and in 
some copyes Mis­
hersing,) that is to be 
quite of amercementes 
before whom soeuer 
of transumption pro­
ued.
 
¶ Abiuration.
ABiuration is an 
othe that a manne 
or woman shall take, 
when they haue com­
mitted Felonie, and 
flie to the Church or 
church yarde for safe­
garde of their lyues, 
choosing rather perpe­
tuall banishment out 
of the Realme, then to 
stand to the Law, & to 
be tried of the felony. 
And this lawe was 
instituted by Saynt 
Edward the Confes­
sour a Kinge of thys 
realme before the con­
quest, & was grounded 
vpon the law of mer­
cie, & for the loue and 

 

reuerence, no doubt, 
that hee and other hys 
successors did beare vn­
to the house of God, 
or place of prayer and 
administration of hys 
woord and sacramen­
tes, which wee cal the 
church. But how vn­
comely a thing it was 
or is, and how farre 
from the nature of the 
house of God, to make 
her a succourer and de­
fender of horrible mur­
ferers & theeues. You 
may consider (brother 
Nicholas) and the ra­
ther when you remem­
ber what our Sauy­
our Christ saide, re­
prehending the Iewes, 
and paraduenture also 
prophesinge of thys. 
My house shalbe cal­
led the house of praier, 
but you haue made it a 
denne of theeues.
 
¶ Abridgement of a plaint 
or demaund.

 

ABridgement of a 
plaint or demaund 
is wher one brin­
geth an Assise, writte 
of dower, writte of 
warde, or such lyke, 
where the writ is,de 
libero tenemento, as in 
a writte of dower, the 
writ is,Rationabilem 
dotem que eam contingit 
de libero tenemento W.
her husband. And in a 
writte of Warde the 
writte is,Custod' ter­
rarum & her&ecedil;d' &c. And 
the plaintyfe or de­
mandant demaundeth 
dyuers acres or par­
cells of lande, and the 
tenant pleadeth Non­
tenure or iointenancy, 
or some other such like 
plee, to parcell of the 
land demaunded, in a­
batement of the writ: 
then the plaintif or de­
mandant, may abridge 
hys plaint or demaund 
to that parcel, that is 
to say, hee may leaue 
that part out and pray 

 

that the tenaunt shall 
aunsweare the rest to 
which he hath not yet 
pleded any thing. The 
cause is, for that in 
such writs the certein­
tye is not set downe, 
but the demaund run­
neth generallyde libe­
ro tenemento, and not­
withstanding the de­
mandant hath abridged 
his plaint or demaund 
in part, yet the writte 
remaineth good stil,de 
libero tenemento for the 
rest.
 
¶ Acceptance.
ACceptance is a ta­
king in good part, 
and as it were an a­
greeing vnto some act 
done before, whych 
might haue ben vndon 
and auoyded (if such 
acceptance had not ben) 
by him or them that so 
accepted. As for exam­
ple, if an Abbot lease 
lande of his house for 

 

terme of yeares, re­
seruinge rent and dy­
eth, and after an o­
ther is made Abbot, 
who accepteth, that 
is to say, taketh or 
receyueth the rente 
when it is due, and 
ought to bee payed: 
Now by this accep­
taunce the lease is 
made perfect and good, 
which els the Abbot 
myght very well haue 
auoyded and made 
frustrate. The lyke 
law is, if a man and 
his wife seised of land 
in the ryght of the 
wyfe ioyne and make 
a lease or feoffement 
reseruinge rent, and 
the husbande dyeth, 
shee accepteth or recei­
ueth the rent, by 
which the feoffement 
or lease is made per­
fecte and good, and 
shal barre her to bring 
her writte calledCui 
in vita.

 

¶ Accessories.
ACcessories are in 
two sorts, the one 
before the offence, 
the other after the of­
fence is done. 
 
Accessorie before the 
fact, or offence, is hee 
that commaundeth or 
procureth an other to 
doe felonie, and is not 
there present him selfe 
when the other doth it 
but if he be present, then 
he is also principal. 
 
Accessory after the of­
fence or fact, is he that 
receyueth, fauoureth, 
or aideth, a felon, know­
ing well of the deede 
that he hath done. 
 
Also one may be acces­
sorie to an accessory, as 
if one feloniously re­
ceyue an other that is 
accessorie of a felonie, 
there the receiuer is an 
accessorie.

 

¶ Accion.
ACcion is a suite 
geeuen by the law 
to recouer a thing, 
as an action of debte 
and such like.
 
¶ Accions personals.
ACcions personals 
bee such accions 
whereby a manne 
claymeth debt, or o­
ther goodes or cattell, 
or dammage for them, 
or damages for wrong 
done to his person.
 
¶ Accion populer.
ACcion populer is 
an accion which is 
geeuen vppon the 
breach of some Penal 
statute; which action 
euery man that wyll 
may sue for him selfe, 
and the Queene, by 
information or other­
wise, as the statute al­

 

loweth and the case 
requyreth. And of 
these actions there bee 
an infinite number, but 
one for example is, 
when any of the iurie 
that are impanelled & 
sworn to passe betwen 
party and party indif­
ferently, do take any 
thing of the one side or 
other, or of both par­
ties, to say their ver­
dicts on that side: then 
any man that wil within 
the yeare next follow­
inge the offence made, 
may sue a writ called 
Decies tantum agaynst 
him or them that so 
did take to geeue their 
verdict, & because that 
this action is not gee­
uen to one man specy­
ally but generally to 
the Queenes people 
that wyll sue, it is 
called an actyon po­
puler.
 
¶ Actions reals.

 

ACtions reals, bee 
such actions where 
by the demaundaunt 
claymeth title to any 
landes or tenementes, 
rentes, or common, in 
fee simple, fee taile, or 
for terme of life.
 
¶ Accorde.
ACcord is an agree­
ment betwene two 
at the least, eyther to 
satisfie an offence, that 
the one hath made to 
the other. Or els it is 
a contract with diuers 
articles to bee done, 
some on the one part, 
and some on the other, 
where there shalbe one 
thinge for an other &c. 
The firste is, when 
a manne hath done a 
trespas, or such like 
vnto an other for the 
which hee hath agreed 
with hym, satisfied 
and contented hym, 
with some recompence 
alreadie executed and 

 

done in deede. And be 
cause that this recom­
pence, is a full satis­
faction for the offence, 
it shalbe a good barre 
in the law, if the other 
should sue againe any 
action for the same 
trespas. The other is, 
when as I.S. letteth 
a chamber for yeres to 
H.G. & it is farther a­
greed betwene them, 
that the said H.G. shal 
be at boorde with the 
said I.S. and shal for 
the same chamber and 
boorde pay to the sayd 
I.S. a certein summe 
&c. this is a contract & 
accorde, with articles 
on both sides.
 
¶ Acquital.
ACquital is where 
there is Lorde, 
mesne, and tenant, 
and the tenant holdeth 
of the Mesne certeyne 
landes or tenementes 
in frankalmoygne, 

 

frankmariage or such 
lyke, and the mesne 
holdethe ouer also of 
the Lord paramount, 
(or aboue him. Nowe 
ought the mesne to ac­
quite or discharge the 
tenant of all and eue­
ry manner of seruice, 
that any other would 
haue or demaunde of 
hym concernynge the 
same landes or tene­
mentes, for that the 
tenaunt must doo his 
seruyce to the mesne 
onely, and not to dy­
uers Lordes for one 
tenement, or parcel of 
lande. The same lawe 
is where there is lord, 
mesne, and tenant, as 
aforesayde, and the 
mesne graunted to the 
tenant (vppon the te­
nure made betweene 
them) to acquite, and 
dyscharge hym of all 
rentes seruyces, and 
such lyke. This dis­
charge is called acqui­
tall.

 

¶ Acquitance.
ACquitance is a dis­
charge in writing, 
of a summe of money, 
or other duetie which 
ought to bee payde, 
or done. As if one be 
bounde to pay money 
vppon an obligation, 
or rent reserued vp­
pon a lease, or such 
like, and the partye 
to whom the money, 
or duety shoulde bee 
payed, or done, vp­
pon the resceit there­
of, or vppon other a­
greement betwene them
had, maketh a wri­
ting, or bil of his hand, 
in discharge thereof, 
witnessing, that hee is 
payed, or otherwyse 
contented, and there­
fore doth acquite, and 
discharge him of the 
same, which acquitance 
is such a discharge and 
barre in the law, that 
hee cannot demaunde, 
and recouer that summe 
or duety againe, con­

 

trary therevnto if hee 
can shew the acquitance.
 
¶ Addicions.
ADdicyon is that, 
that is geuen vnto 
a man, but chiefely to 
the defendaunt, in ac­
tyons where proces 
of outlawrie do lie, as 
in det, and such like, 
ouer and besides hys 
proper name and sir­
name that is to say to 
shewe of what estate 
or degree, or myste­
rye hee is, and of what 
Towne or Hamlet or 
County. 
 
Additions of Estate 
are these, yeoman, gen­
tleman, Esquire, and 
such like. 
 
Addityons of de­
gree are those that 
we cal names of dig­
nitye, as Knight, 
Earls, Marques, and 
Duke. 
 
Additions of mistery 

 

are suche, Scryue­
ner, Painter, Mason, 
Carpenter, Tayler, 
Smith, & so all other 
of like nature, for mis­
tery is the craft or oc­
cupation, wherby a man
getteth his liuinge. 
 
Addicions of tow­
nes, as Sale, Dale, 
and such, and so of the 
rest. 
 
And where a man 
hath houshold in two 
places, he shalbe said 
dwellinge in both of 
them, so that his addici­
on in one of them doth 
suffice. 
 
And this was or­
dayned by a Statute 
made in the first yere 
of H.5. cap. 5. to the 
intent that one man 
shoulde not bee gree­
ued nor troubled by 
the vtlawry of an other, 
but that by reason of 
the certeine addicion, 
euery man myght bee 
certeinely knowne, and 
beare his own burden.

 

¶ Adiournement.
ADiourement is

¶ Administratour.
ADministratour is 
hee to whome the 
ordinary commit­
teth theadministration 
of the goods of a dead 
man, for defaut of an 
executour, and an acti­
on shal lie against him 
and for him as for an 
executour, & he shalbee 
charged to the value of 
the goods of the dead 
man & no further, if it 
be not by his own false 
plee, or for that that 
he hath wasted the goods 
of the dead, but if thad­
ministratour die, hys 
executours be not ad­
ministratours: but it 
behoueth the Ordinarie 

 

to commit a newe ad­
ministration, but if a 
straunger that is not 
Administratour nor 
executoure take the 
goodes of the dead and 
minyster of hys owne 
wronge, hee shalbee 
charged and sued as 
an executour & not as 
administratour in any 
action that is brought 
against hym by any 
creditour. But if the 
ordinary make a letter 
ad colligendum bona de­
functi, he that hath such 
a letter is not Admy­
nistratour, but the ac­
tion lyeth against the 
Ordinary, as wel as if 
he tooke the goodes to 
his owne hande, or 
by the hande of any of 
hys seruauntes by a­
ny other commaunde­
ment.
 
¶ Actes.
ACtes of parliament 
are positiue lawes 
which consist of two 

 

partes, that is to say, 
of the words of the act 
& of the sence thereof, 
& they both ioined to­
gether make the lawe.
 
¶ Admiral.
ADmirall is an offi­
cer vnder the Queene 
that hath aucthoritie, 
vpon the sea onely, to 
see the nauie repaired, 
& maintained, to sup­
presse, and chase away 
robbers, and rouers 
and to deale in mat­
ters betweene party, 
and partie, concerning 
thinges done there, 
and for that purpose 
hath his court called 
the Admiralty: yet he 
may cause his Citati­
on to be serued vppon 
the lande, and take the 
parties body, or goods, 
in execution vpon the 
land. And also he hath 
cognisance of the death 
or mayhem of man com­
mitted in any great 

 

ship fleetinge in great 
riuers in the land be­
neth the bridges of the
same next the sea, also 
to arrest ships in the 
great streames for the 
vyages of the Queene 
and Realme, and hath 
iurisdiction in the said 
streames duringe the 
same viages.
 
¶ Aduowson.
ADuowson is where 
a man, & his heires 
haue right to present 
their Clerke to the or­
dinarye, to a perso­
nage, or other spiri­
tuall benefice when it 
becommeth void. And 
hee that hath suche 
right to present, is cal­
led patron.
 
¶ Age prier.
AGe prier is when 
an action is brought 
agaynst an infaunt, of 
landes that he hath by 
discent, there he shall 
shewe the matter to 
the court, and shal pray 

 

that the action shall a­
abide till his ful age of 
one and twenty yeres, 
and so by awarde of 
the court, the suit shal 
surcesse: But in a writ 
of Dower and in As­
sise, & also in such ac­
tions where the infant 
commeth in of his owne 
wrong he shal not haue 
his age. 
 
Also note well, that 
there be many diuersi­
ties of ages, for the lord 
shal haue ayd of his te­
naunt in socage for to 
marrye his daughter 
when the daughter of 
the Lorde is of thage 
of vij. yeres, and also 
aide for to make hys 
sonne & heire knight, 
when he is of the age 
of vij. yeres. 
 
Also a woman which 
is maried at the age of 
ix. yeres if her husband 
die seysed, shall haue 
dower and not before 
nine yeres. 
 
Also xiiij. yeres is the 

 

age of a woman that she 
shal not be in warde if 
she were of such age at 
the time of the death of 
her auncester, but if she 
were within the age 
of xiiij. yeares and in 
warde of the lord, then
she shalbe in ward till 
the age of xvi. yeres & 
also xxi. yeares is the 
age of the heire male to 
be in ward, & after that 
out of warde, & also it 
is the age of male and 
female to sue & to bee 
sued of landes which 
they haue or claime by 
discent and to make al 
maner of contractes & 
bargains & not before: 
but if such an infaunt 
within the age of xxi. 
yeres geue his goods, & 
the donee take them, he 
may haue an action of 
trespas, but otherwise 
it is if he deliuer them 
him selfe.
 
¶ Agreement.
AGreement is after this 
sorte defined or ex­

 

pounded in Master 
Plowdens Commenta­
ries:Aggreamentum
is a worde compoun­
ded of two wordes 
namely ofAggrega­
tio, andMentium, that 
is to saye agreement 
of minds, so the agrement 
is a consent of mindes 
in some thinge done, 
or to bee done, and 
by drawynge toge­
ther of the ij. wordes 
Aggregatio, andMen­
tium, and by the has­
tye and shorte pro­
nouncinge of them, 
to witt,Aggreamen­
tum, which is no other 
thing, then a ioining, 
putting, cupling, and 
knitting together of 
ij. or moe mindes in a­
ny thinge done, or to 
be done. See after in 
Testament. 
 
And this agreement 
is in 3. maners. The j. 
is an agrement executed 

 

all ready, at the bee­
ginning. The seconde 
is an agreement after 
an act done, by an o­
ther and is an agree­
ment executed also. 
The third is an agre­
ment executorie or to 
be done in time yet to 
come. The first, which 
is an agreement exe­
cuted already at the be­
ginning, is such where 
of mencion is made in 
the statute of 25.E.3. 
ca. 3. of clothes, in the 
4. statute which saith, 
that the goods & things 
bought by forestallers 
being therof attainted, 
shalbee forfayt to the 
Queene, if the buyer 
haue therof made gree 
wyth the seller, in 
which case, this word 
(Gree) which is other 
wise called agrement, 
shalbe vnderstood agre­
ment executed, that is pai­
ment for the things. The 
second maner of agre­

 

ment, is where one 
doth a thinge, or acte, 
and an other agrees or 
aisentes thereto after­
warde, as if one do a 
disseisin to my vse, and 
after I agree to it, now 
I shall bee a disseisour 
from the beginninge, 
and such agreement is 
an agreement after an 
act done. 
 
The thirde agree­
ment is when bothe 
partyes at one tyme 
are agreed, that such a 
thinge shalbee done in 
tyme to come, and this 
agreement is executo­
rie, in as much as the 
thing shalbe done af­
ter, and yet there, their 
mindes agreed at one 
time, but because the 
perfourmance shalbee 
afterwarde, and so the 
thing vpon which the 
agreement was made 
remaynes to be done, 
that agreement shall 
bee sayde executorye. 
And that the statute 

 

of 26. H. 8. cap. 3. 
doth proue, where it 
sayth, that euery vi­
car, person, and such 
lyke &c. before their 
actuall possessyon or 
medling with the pro­
fits of their benefice, 
shall satisfie, content 
&c. or agree to pay to 
the vse of the Queene, 
the first fruits &c. and 
if any such person, vi­
car &c. enter in actu­
al possession &c. this 
agrement is to be vn­
derstoode executory as 
the comon vse proues, 
for it is vsed, that hee, 
with one, or ij. with him 
doe make two or three 
obligations for it, to 
bee payed at certayne 
dayes after. And this 
agreement executory, 
is deuyded in two 
pointes, One is an 
agreement executory, 
which is certeyne at 
the beginning, as is 
sayde laste before of 
the first fruits. 

 

The other is, where 
the certeinty doth not 
appeare at the first, 
and the partyes are a­
greed, that the thinge 
shalbe perfourmed, or 
payed, vppon the cer­
teinty knowen. As if 
one sell to an other, 
al his wheat in such 
a tasse in his barne vn­
threshed, and it is a­
greed betweene them, 
that he shal pay for e­
uery bushel xij. d. when
it is threshed cleaned 
& measured.
 
¶ Aide.
AIde is when tenant 
for terme of life, te­
naunt in dower, te­
nant by curtesie, or te­
nant in taile after pos­
sibilitye of issue ex­
tinct is impleded, then 
for that that they 
haue noe estate but for 
terme of lyfe, they shal 
pray in ayde of him in 
the reuersion, and pro­
ces shall bee made by 

 

writt against him, to 
come & plede with the 
tenant in the defence 
of the land if he will, 
but it behoueth that 
they agree in the plee, 
for if they vary, the plee 
of the tenaunt shalbee 
taken & then the ayde 
praier is void, but if he 
come not at the second 
writ, then the tenant 
shall aunswere sole. 
Also tenant for terme 
of yeres, tenant at wil, 
tenant by Elegit, and 
tenant by statute mer­
chaunt, shall haue aide 
of him in the reuersi­
on, and the seruaunt 
and baily of their ma­
ster when they haue 
done any thing law­
fully in the ryght of 
their master, shal haue 
ayde. 
 
Ayde of the Kinge 
is in lyke case as it is 
sayd before of a com­
mon person, and al­
so in many other cases 

 

where the kinge may 
haue losse, although 
that the tenant be te­
nant in fee simple hee 
shall haue aide, as if 
a rent bee demaunded 
against the kinges te­
naunt whych holdeth 
in chiefe, hee shal haue 
ayde, and so hee shall 
not haue of a common 
person. 
 
Also where a Citie 
or Boroughe hath a 
fee ferme of the kinge, 
and any thing bee de­
maunded against them 
whiche belongeth to 
the fee ferme, they shal 
haue aide for the losse 
of the king. 
 
Also a man shal haue 
ayde of the king in the 
steede of voucher. Also 
the kinges Bailife, 
the collector and pur­
ueyour shall haue aide 
of the kinge, as well 
as the officers of o­
ther persons.
 
¶ Alyen.

 

ALien is he whose 
father & him selfe 
were both borne 
out of the Queenes 
legeance, and if such 
an alien beeing none of 
the Queenes enemies 
but an alyen friende, 
come and dwel here in 
England & haue issue, 
this issue is no alyen 
but English. So if an 
English man go ouer 
the Seas with the 
Queenes licence, and 
there hath issue, this 
issue is no alien.
 
¶ Alienation.
ALienation is as 
much to say, as to 
make a thing an other 
mans, to alter or put 
the possession of lande 
or other thinge from 
one man to another.
 
¶ Ambidexter.
AMbydexter ys 
he, that when a 

 

matter is in suit bee­
twene men, taketh 
money of the one side 
and of the other, either 
to labor the suit, or such 
like, or if he bee of the 
iury, to say his verdict
 
¶ Amendement.
AMendement is, 
when errour is in 
the processe, the Iusti­
ces may amende if af­
ter iudgement. But if 
there be errour in gee­
uing of iudgement, they 
may not amend it, but 
the party is put to his 
writ of Error. And in 
many cases where the 
default appeareth in the
clerk that writeth the 
record it shalbe amen­
ded: but such thinges 
as come by informati­
on of the partie, as the 
towne, misterie, & such 
like, shal not be amen­
ded, for he must inform 
true vpon his peryl.
 
¶ Amercement.

 

AMercement most 
properly is that in 
a Court Baron, 
leete or lawday, which 
in a Court of Recorde 
before Iustices is cal­
led a fine, and it is a 
penaltie assessed by the 
homage for an offence 
done agaynst the same 
court, as for lacke of 
suit of Court, or for 
not amending of some 
thing that he was ap­
pointed to redresse by 
a certeine time at the 
laste Court day be­
fore, or for such lyke 
cause.
 
¶ Amercement royal.
AMercement royal 
is when a Shirif, 
coroner, or other 
suche Officer of the 
Queene is amerced by 
the Iustices for hys 
abuse in the office.
 
¶ An, iour, & wast.

 

AN, iour, & wast is a 
forfaiture when a 
man hath commit­
ted petit Treason, or 
felony, and hath lands 
which hee holdeth of 
some common person 
which shalbe seised for 
the Queene, & remain 
in her hands by the space 
of one yere & a day next 
after the attainder, and 
then the trees shalbe dig­
ged vp, the houses shalbe 
rased & pulled downe, 
& the pastures & mea­
dowes eyred & plowed 
vp, a thing the more to 
greeue the offendors, & 
terrifie other to fal in­
to the like, in shewing 
how the law doth de­
test their offence, so 
farre forth as that it 
doth execute iudgement 
& punishment euen vp 
on their dum & deade 
thinges.
 
¶ Annuitie.
ANnuitie is a cer­
tein summe of mo­
ney graunted to an 

 

other, in fee simple, fee 
taile, for terme of life, 
or for terme of yeres, 
to receiue of the graun­
tor or his heires, so 
that no fee is charged 
there with.
 
¶ Appeale.
APpeal is where one 
hath done murder, 
robery or felony, then 
the wife of him that is 
slain shal haue an acci­
on of appeale against the
murderer: but if hee 
haue no wife, then his 
next heir male shall 
haue the appeale at a­
nye time within the 
yere and day after the 
deede. And also he that 
is so robbed, shal haue 
his appeal within the 
same time, & if the defendant. 
be acquited he shal re­
couer damages against 
the appellor, & thabet­
tors, & they shal haue 
the imprisonment of a 
yere, & shall make fine 
to the king. 

 

An Appeale of Mai­
hem is in maner but 
an action of trespas, 
for he shal recouer but 
damages.
 
¶ Appellant.
APpellant is the 
plaintif in the appeal
 
¶ Appellour.
APpellour or appro­
uer, is he who hath 
committed some felony 
which hee confesseth, 
and now appealeth or 
approueth, that is to 
say, accuseth other 
that were coadiutors, 
or helpers with hym, 
in doing the same, or 
other felonies, whych 
thing he wil approue, 
& therefore is called in 
latinProbator.
 
¶ Appendant & appurtenant
APpendant et appurte­
nant are things that 
by time of prescription

 

haue belonged, pertei­
ned, and are ioyned to 
another principal thing 
with which they passe 
and goe as accessarie 
to the same principal 
thinge, by vertue of 
these wordes Pertinen­
tijs: as land, aduowsons 
commons, piscaries, 
wayes, courtes, & dy­
uers such lyke, to a 
manour, house, office, 
or such other.
 
¶ Apporcionment.
APporcionment is 
a deuydinge into 
partes of a rent 
(which is deuidable & 
not entier or whole,) 
and for so much as the 
thing for which, or of 
which it was to bee 
paied, is seperated and 
deuided, the rent also 
shalbe deuided, hauing 
respect to the partes. As 
if a man haue a rent ser­
uice issuing out of lands 
& he purchaseth parcel 

 

of the lande, the rent 
shalbe apporcioned ac­
cording to the value of 
the lande. 
 
So if a man hold his 
lande of an other by 
Homage, Fealty, Es­
cuage, and certeine 
rent, if the Lorde of 
whom the lande is 
holden purchase pur­
cell of the lande, the 
rent shalbee apporcio­
ned. 
 
Also if a man lett 
landes and goodes for 
yeares reseruing rent, 
and after a straunger 
recouereth the lande, 
then the rent shalbee 
apporcioned, because 
the goodes are not re­
couered, but remayne. 
And so it is if but 
part of the lande bee 
recouered the rent shal 
bee apporcioned, that 
is to say, deuyded, and 
the lessee shall pay, ha­
uinge respect to that 
whych is recouered, 
and to that whiche 

 

yet remaines in hys 
handes, according to 
the value. 
 
But a rent charge 
can not be apporcio­
ned, nor thinges that 
are entier. As if one 
hold land by seruice to 
pay to his lord yerely 
at such a feast a horse, 
a Hauke, a Rose, a 
Cherry or suche like. 
There if the Lorde 
purchase parcel of the 
lande, this seruice is 
gone altogether, be­
cause a Horse, a 
Hauke, a Rose, a 
Cherry, and such o­
ther, can not bee deui­
ded, seuered, nor 
apporcioned without 
hurt to the whole
 
¶ Appropriation.
APpropryacions 
were when those 
houses of the Ro­
mish Religion, & those 

 

religious persons, as 
Abbottes, Priours, 
and suche lyke, had 
the aduowson of a­
nye Parsonage to 
them, and to their 
successours, and ob­
tayned lycence of 
their holie father the 
Pope, that they them 
selues and their suc­
cessours from thence 
forth should bee par­
sones there, and serue 
the cure. And so at 
the beginnynge ap­
propryations weare 
made onelye to those 
persons spiritual that 
could minister the sa­
craments and say de­
uyne seruice, as Ab­
bottes, Pryours, 
Deanes, and suche 
lyke: After by lyttle 
and little, they were 
enlarged and made to 
other, as namely to 
a Deane and Chap­
ter, whych is a bodye 
corporate, consystinge 

 

of manie, which bodie 
together, coulde not 
say deuine seruice, and 
what more was to 
Nunnes that were 
Prioresses of some 
Nunrie, which was 
a wicked thinge, in 
so much as they could 
neither minister Sa­
craments nor preach, 
nor say deuine seruyce 
to the Parishioners. 
And al this was vp­
pon pretence of hospi­
talitie, and maynte­
naunce thereof. And 
to supply these defects 
a Vicar was deuysed, 
who should be deputy 
to the Priores, or to 
the Deane and Chap­
ter, and also at the last 
to the saide Abbots & 
others, to say deuine 
seruice, & should haue 
for his labor but a lit­
tle porcion, & they to 
whom the appropria­
tion was made, should 
retaine the great re­
uenues, and they dyd 

 

nothinge for it, by 
meanes whereof hos­
pitalitye decayed in 
the place where yt 
ought to haue beene 
chiefely mainteyned, 
namely in the paryshe 
where the benefyce 
was, and were the 
profits did growe, 
and so it contynueth 
to this day, to the 
great hynderaunce of 
learning, the impoue­
rishment of the My­
nisterie, and the infa­
mie of the Gospel and 
professors thereof.
 
¶ Approuement.
APprouement, is 
where a manne 
hath common in 
the Lordes waste 
ground, and the Lord 
encloseth part of the 
wast for him selfe, lea­
uinge neuer the lesse 
suffycient common, 

 

with egresse and re­
gresse for the commo­
ners: This enclo­
singe is called ap­
prouement.
 
¶ Arbitrement.
ARbitrement is an 
awarde, deter­
minatyon, or iudg­
ment, which one, or 
moe, maketh at the 
request of two par­
ties at the least, for, 
and vppon some debt, 
trespas, or other con­
trouersie, had betwene 
the said partis. And 
this is called in latine 
Arbitratus, and arbitri­
um, and they that 
make the awarde or 
arbitrement, are cal­
led Arbitri, in English 
Arbitrators.
 
¶ Arrest.
ARrest is when 
one is taken and 
restrayned from 

 

his lybertye, none 
shall bee arrested for 
debt, trespas, detynue, 
or other cause of ac­
cyon, but by vertue 
of precept, or com­
maundement out of 
some court. But for 
treason, felony, or bre­
kinge of the peace, e­
uery man hath auc­
thority to arrest with 
out warrant or pre­
cept, and where one 
shall bee arrested for 
felony, it behoueth that
there hath bene some 
felony done, and that 
he be suspected of the 
same felony, or other­
wise he may haue a­
gainst him that so dyd 
arrest him, a writte of 
false imprysonment.
 
¶ Arrerages.
ARrerages, are du­
eties behinde vn­
payed after the 
daies & times in which 
they were due, and 

 

ought to haue bene 
paied, whether they be 
rent of a mannour or 
any other thinge re­
serued.
 
¶ Assets.
ASsets is in two 
sortes, the one 
called assets per dis­
cent, the other assets en­
ter maines. Assets per 
discent, is where a man 
is bound in an obliga­
tion and dieth seised of 
landes in fee simple, 
which discende to hys 
heire, but maketh no 
executors, or if hee 
make executors lea­
ueth not sufficient goodz 
to discharge this obli­
gation, then this land 
shalbe called Assets, 
that is to say, enough 
or sufficient to pay the 
same det, and by that 
meanes the heire shal­
bee charged, as faire 
as the lande so to 
hym dyscended wyll 

 

stretche: But if hee 
haue alyened before 
the obligatyon be put 
in suite, hee is dys­
charged. 
 
Also when a man 
seised of lands in taile, 
or in the right of hys 
wife, alieneth the same 
with warrantie, and 
hath in value as much 
land in fee simple which 
discendeth to his heire, 
who is also heire in 
taile, or heire to the 
woman: Now if the 
heire after the discease 
of his auncestor bring 
a writ of Formedon, or 
sur Cui in vita for the 
lande so alyened, then 
hee shal bee barred by 
reason of the war­
rantye and the lande 
so dyscended, which 
is as much in value 
as that that was sold, 
and so thereby he hath 
receiued no preiudice, 
and therfore this land 
is called Assetes per 
discent. 

 

Assets enter maines, is 
when a man indebted 
as before is sayde, ma­
keth executours and 
leaueth to them suffici­
ent to pay, or some com­
modity or profit is come 
to them in right of their 
testatour, this is said 
assets in their handes.
 
¶ Assignee.
ASsignee is hee to 
whom a thing is ap­
pointed, or assigned to 
be occupyed, payed, or 
don, & is alwaies such 
a person which occupi­
eth or hath the thing so 
assigned in his owne 
right, & for him selfe. 
And of assignees there 
be ij. sortz. Namely assig­
nee in deed, & assignee 
in law, assignee in deed 
is when a leas is graun­
ted to a man & to his as­
signees or without those 
wordes, assignees & the
grauntee giueth, graun­
teth, or selleth the same 
leas to an other, he is 
his assignee in deede. 

 

Assignee in law is 
euery executor named 
by the testator in hys 
testament, as if a leas 
be made to a man and 
to his assignees (as is 
aforesaid) and he ma­
keth his executors & 
dieth without issigne­
ment of the leas to a­
ny other, now the exe­
cutors shall haue the 
same leas because they 
are his assygnees in 
law, & so it is in diuers 
other like cases.
 
¶ Attainder.
ATtainder is a con­
uiction of any person, 
of a crime, or fault, 
whereof he was not 
conuicte before, as if 
a man haue committed 
felony, Treason, or 
such like, and thereof 
is endicted, arrained, & 
founde gilty, and hath 
iudgement, then he is 
sayd to bee attainted, 
& this may be ij. waies 
the one vpon apparance, 
the other vpon default 

 

The attainder vppon 
apparaunce is by con­
fession, Battaile, or 
verdict. The attainder 
vppon defaulte is by 
processe.
 
¶ Auerment.
AUerment is where 
a man pleadeth a 
plee in abatement of 
the writt or barre of 
the action which hee 
sayth hee is ready to 
proue as the court wil

proue his ple is called 
an auerment.
 
¶ Auerpeny.
AUerpeny that is 
to bee quite of di­
uers summes of 
money for the kinges 
auerages.

"Auerpeny" not found in OED as a headword (but see "aver-," comb. form.) 


 
¶ Auncien demesne.
AUncien demesne, are 
certein tenures hol­
den of those manors that

 

were in the handes of 
Saint Edwarde the 
confessour, and the 
which hee made to be 
written in a booke cal­
led Domes day, sub 
titulo Regis, and all the 
landes holden of the 
sayd manours be aun­
cyen demesne, and the 
tenauntes shall not be 
impleaded out of the 
sayd manours, and if 
they bee, they may 
shewe the matter, and 
abate the writte, but 
if they aunswere to 
the writte, and iudge­
ment bee geuen, then 
the lands become frank 
fee for euer. Also the 
tenauntes in auncien 
demeane bee free of 
tolle for all thinges 
concerninge their sus­
tenaunce and husban­
dry in auncien demesne, 
and for such landes 
they shal not be put or 
impanelled vppon any 
inquest. But al the lands 
in auncyen demeane 

 

that are in the kings 
handes bee frankefee, 
and pleadable at the 
common lawe. See 
more after in the ty­
tle Sokemans.
 
¶ Auowrie.
AVowrye is where 
one taketh a distres 
for rent or other thing 
and the other sueth a 
repleuin, then he that 
hath taken it, shal ius­
tifie in his plee for 
what cause he toke it 
and so auowe the ta­
kinge, and that is cal­
ed his auowrye.
 
¶ Baile.
BAile is when a 
man is taken, or 
arrested, for felo­
ny, suspition of felo­
ny, endicted of felo­
ny, or any such case, 
so that he is restray­
ned of his lybertye: 
And beeinge by lawe 
baileable offreth suer­
ty, to those that haue au­

 

thority to baile hym 
which suerties are 
bounde for him to the 
Queenes vse in a cer­
taine summe of money 
or bodye for bodye, 
that he shall appeare 
beefore the Iustices 
of Gaole deliuery at 
the next sessions &c. 
Then vpon the bonds 
of these suerties, as 
is aforesaide, he is 
bailed, that is to say, 
sett at libertye, vntil 
the day appointed for 
his apparance.
 
¶ Bailement
  
BAilement is a dely­
uery of things (whe­
ther it be of wry­
tinges, goodes, or 
stuffe) to an other, 
some times to be rede­
liuered backe to the 
bailor, that is to saye, 
to him that so deliuered it 
sometimes to the vse of 
the baily, that is to say of 
him to whom it is dely­
uered, & sometims also it 
is deliuered to a 3.person

 

This deliuery is cal­
led a bailement.

"bailor" antedates the earliest OED citation (1602). 


 
¶ Bailife.
BAilife is an offi­
cer that belongeth 
to a mannour to 
order the husbandry, 
and hath aucthoritye. 
to paye quitrents is­
suing out of the man­
nour, fell trees, repaire 
houses, make pales, 
hedges, distrain beasts 
vpon the ground, and 
diuers such like. This 
officer is hee whome 
the auncient Saxons 
called a Reeue: for the 
name (Baylife) was 
not then knowne a­
monge them: but came 
in with the Normans, 
and is called in latin 
villicus.
 
¶ Bakberinde theefe.
BAkberind Theefe, 
is a theefe that is 
taken with the ma­
ner, that is to say, hauing 
that found vppon him 
(being followed with the 

 

hue and crie) which he 
hath stollen whether 
it bee money, linnen, 
wollen, or other stuffe 
but it is moste pro­
perlye sayed when hee 
is taken, carryinge 
those thinges, that 
hee hath stollen in a 
bundel, or fardel, vpon 
his backe.
 
¶ Bargaine & sale.
BArgaine and sale, 
is when a recom­
pence is geuen by 
both the partyes to 
the bargayne. As if 
one bargaine and sell 
his land to another for 
money. Here the lande 
is a recompence to him 
for the money, and the 
mony is a recompence 
to the other for the land, 
and this is a good con­
tract and bargaine, and 
fee simple passeth, not­
withstandyng he doth 
not saye, to haue and 
to holde the lande to 
him and to his heires. 

 

And by such a bargain 
and sale, landes maye 
passe without lyuerye 
of seisin, if the bargain 
and sale be by deed in­
dented, sealed, and in­
rolled, either in the coun­
ty where the land ly­
eth, or in one of the 
Queenes courtes of 
Records at Westmin­
ster, within vj. moneths 
next after the date of 
the same writinge en­
dented according to the
statute in that behalfe 
made in the 27. yeare 
of H.8.ca.16.
 
¶ Barre.
BArre is when the 
defendant in any ac­
tion pledeth a ple which 
is a sufficient answere 
and that destroieth the 
actyon of the plaintife 
for euer.
 
¶ Bastarde.
BAstard is he that is 
borne of any woman

 

not maried so that his 
father is not knowen 
by the order of the law, 
& therefore he is called 
the child of the people. 
But by the law spiri­
tual if one get a childe 
vpon a woman which 
childe is borne out of 
wedloke, and after hee 
marry the same woman, 
then such a child shalbe 
said mulier & not bas­
tarde. But by the law 
of England it is a bas­
tarde: & for that cause 
when such special bas­
tardye is alleaged, it 
shalbe tried by the coun­
trey and not by the 
Byshoppe. But ge­
nerall bastardye allea­
ged shall bee tried by 
the certificat of the 
Bishop. 
 
And if a woman be 
great with childe by 
her husband who dieth 
& she taketh an other 
husband, & after the child 
is borne, this childe 
shalbe said the child of 

 

the firste husbande. 
But if shee were pri­
uely wyth childe at 
the time of the death of 
her first husband, then 
it shalbe said the child of 
the second husband, but en­
quire farther, and see 
the opinion of Thorpe 
21. E. 3. 39. 
 
Also if a man take 
a wife which is great 
with childe by an o­
ther that was not her 
husband, and after the 
childe is borne within 
the espousels, then 
hee shal bee saide the 
childe of the husband, 
though it were borne 
but one day after the 
espousels solempny­
sed.
 
¶ Battaile.
BAttaile is an aun­
cyent tryal in our 
law, which the defen­
daunt in an appeale of 
felony may choose, that 
is to say, to fight with 
the appellaunt, for 
proofe whether he bee 

 

culpable of the felony 
or not: which com­
bate if it fall out so 
wel on the part of the 
defendant, that he doe 
vanquishe the appel­
lant, he shal go quite, & 
barre him of his appel 
for euer. But if one be 
indicted of felony, and 
an appell is brought 
vpon the same indicte­
ment, there the defen­
daunt shall not wage 
battayle. Battaile al­
so may be in a writ of 
right.
 
¶ Bigamy.
BIgamy was a coun­
terplea (deuised at 
the Councel of Lions 
vpon mislike of second 
mariage) to be obiected 
when the prisoner demaun­
deth the benefit of the 
Clergie, to wit hys 
book, as namely to say, 
that he which demaun­
deth the priuiledge of 
the clergy, was mari­
ed to such a woman, at 

 

such a place within such a 
diocesse, & that shee is 
dead, and that he hath 
since maried an other 
woman, within the 
same dioces, or within 
some other dioces, and 
so is Bigamus. Or if 
hee haue bin but once 
maryed, then that is to 
say that shee whom he 
hath maried, is or was 
a widowe, that is to 
say the left woman of 
such a one &c. which 
thinge shalbee tried by 
the Bishoppe of the 
dyocesse, where the 
maryages are allea­
ged. And beinge so 
certyfied by the By­
shoppe, the prisoner 
shall loose the bene­
fite of the clergie. But 
at this day, by force 
of the act made in An­
no 1.E.6.cap.12. this 
is noe plea, but that 
he may haue his Cler­
gie that notwithstanding. 
 
Soe is Brooke ti­
tulo Clergie Placito 20.

 

to the same purpose. 
And hereuppon, if 
you be desirous (Bro­
ther Nicholas) to see 
what reasons they 
haue that perswade a­
gainst seconde marry­
ages, reade, amonge 
manye other, Fraun­
ches Petrach of Reme­
dies for both fortunes 
the first booke & lxxvj. 
Dyalogue intituled 
of seconde marriage, 
which booke nowe of 
late our brother Twyne 
hath verye well and 
with good grace (as 
they that can iudge do 
say) translated out of 
latin into Englishe, & 
most aptlye called it 
Phisicke against for­
tune.
 
¶ Blodewit.
BLodewit, that is to 
be quite of amerce­
ments for blodsheding 
& what pleas are hol­
den in your court you 

 

shall haue the Amerce­
mentes thereof coming 
because (wit) in En­
glish is Misericordia in 
latine.
 
¶ Boote.
Boote is an old woord, 
& signifyethe helpe 
succour, ayde, or 
aduauntage, and is 
commonly ioyned with 
an other word whose 
signification it doth 
augment, as these brig­

boote, & diuers such

fications, looke in their

uers sonnes and dieth, 
yet the yongest sonne 
onely shall enheryte

and tenementes that 
were hys Fathers, 
whereof he dyed sey­
sed within the same 
burgh by discent, as 
heire to his father, by 
force of the custome of 
the same borough.
 
¶ Burglarie.
BVrglarie is when 
one breaketh and 
entreth into the house 
of another in the night 
with felonious intent 
to robbe or kill, or to 
do some other felonie, 
in whiche cases al­
though he carie away 
nothing, yet is it felo­
nie, for which he shal 
suffer death. Other­
wise it is if it be in the 
day time, or that hee 
break the house in the 
night, and enter not 
therein at that time. 

 

But if a seruant wil 
conspire wyth other 
men to robbe his Ma­
ster, and to that intent 
he openeth hys Ma­
sters doores or wyn­
dowes in the nyght 
for them, and they 
come into the house 
by that way, thys 
is Burglarye in the 
straungers, and the 
seruant is a theefe but 
no burglar. And this 
was the opinion of 
the Right worshipful 
Syr Roger Manwoode 
Knight, most woor­
thy Lord chiefe Ba­
ron of the Eschequer, 
at the Quarter Ses­
sions holden in Can­
terburie in Ianuarie 
last 1579. 21. Eli­
zabeth.

CEsion, is when an 
ecclesiastical person 
is created Bishop, or 
when a Parson of a 
parsonage taketh ano­
ther benefice wythout 
dispensation, or other­
wise not qualified &c. 
In both cases, theyr 
first benefices are be­
come voide, & to those 
that he had who was 
created bishop, the Q. 
shal present for that time 
whosoeuer be patron 
of them. And in the 
other case, the patron 
may present.
 
¶ Challenge.
CHallenge, is where 
Iurours appeare 
to trie an issue, then 
if anye, of the par­
ties suppose that they 
are not indyfferent, 

 

they may there chal­
lenge and refuse them. 
There be diuers chal­
lenges, one is chal­
lenge to the array, the 
other to the polles. 
Challenge to tharray 
is when the panell is 
fauourably made by 
the Sherife or other 
Officer. Challenge by 
the polles, are some 
principal, and some by 
cause as they call it. 
Principall is when 
one of the Iurors is 
the sonne, brother, or 
cousin, to the plaintyfe 
or defendant or tenant 
to him, or that he hath 
espoused the daughter 
of the plaintife, & for 
those causes hee shalbe 
withdrawen. 
 
Also in a plee of the 
death of a man, and in 
euery other action real 
& in actions personal, 
if the debt or damages 
amount to xl. Markes 
it is a good challenge, 
that he cannot dispende 

 

xl. s. by the yeare of 
freeholde. 
 
Challenge by cause, 
is where the partye 
doth alleage a matter 
which is no principall 
challenge, as that the 
sonne of one of the iu­
rors hath espoused the 
daughter of the plain­
tife, & then he doth con­
clude, & therefore he is 
fauorable, whych shal 
be tried by others of 
thenquest, whether he 
be fauorable or indif­
ferent, and if they say 
that is fauorable & 
not indifferent, then he 
shalbee drawen out, 
otherwise he shalbee 
sworne. Also a Felon 
that is arraigned may 
challenge xx. Iurours 
peremptorie without 
any cause, and that is 
in fauor of life: and as 
many as he will wyth 
cause, but then it shal be 
tried if for such cause 
he be indifferent or not.
 
¶ Champertours.

 

CHampertors be they 
that moue plees and 
suites, or cause to bee 
moued by their owne, 
or others procurement, 
and sue them at their 
owne costes to haue 
part of the lande, or 
gaines in variance.
 
¶ Charge.
CHarge is where a 
man graunteth a 
rent out of his ground, 
and that if the rent be 
behinde, that is shal be 
lawfull for him, hys 
heyres and assygnes 
to distreine tyll the 
rent be paide, this is 
called a rent charge. 
But if one graunt a 
rent charge out of the 
lande of an other, 
and after purchase the 
lande, the graunt is 
voyde.
 
¶ Charters of landes.

 

CHarters of landes, 
are writings, deeds 
euidences, and in­
struments, made from 
one man to an other 
vpon some estate con­
ueyed or passed bee­
twene them, of landes 
or tenements, shewing 
the name, place, & quan­
tity of the land, the es­
tate, time, & maner of 
the doing, thereof, the par­
ties to the estate deliue­
red & taken, the witnes­
ses present at the same 
with other circumstances.
 
¶ Chattels.
CHattels are in two 
sorts, that is to say 
chatels reals, & cha­
tels personals. Cha­
tels reals, are leases 
for yeares, wardes, 
and to holde at will 
&c. 
 
Chattels personalz 
are al moueable goods 
as Money, Plate, 
houshold stuffe, horses 

 

kyne, corne, and suche

his people, for the free 
holde is in the Lorde 
of the soile, and all the 
profit growinge there 
as trees, and other 
thinges.
 
¶ Thinge in action.
THinge in actyon, 
is when a manne 

 

hath cause, or may 
bringe an actyon for 
some dutye due to him 
as an actyon of debt 
vpon an oblagation, 
annuity, rent, couenant 
warde, goodes, trespas 
or such like. And bee­
cause they are thinges 
whereof a man is not 
possessed, but for reco­
uery of them is driuen
to his actyon, they are 
called things in action, 
& those things in acti­
on that are certeine, 
the Queene may grant 
and the grauntee may 
vse an action for them 
in his owne name on­
ly. But a common per­
son can not graunte 
hys thinge in actyon, 
nor the Queene her 
selfe can not graunt 
her thinge in actyon 
which is vncerteyne, 
as trespas & such like.
 
¶ Circuit of action.
CIrcuite of action is 
when an actyon is 

 

rightly brought for a 
dutye: but yet about that
bushe as it were, for that
it might aswel bene 
otherwise aunswered 
and determined, and that
suite saued, and bee­
cause that the same ac­
tion was more then 
needefull, it is called 
circuite of actyon. As 
if a man graunt a rent 
charge of x. li. out of 
his mannour of Dale, 
and after the graun­
tee disseise the graun­
tour of the same Ma­
nour of Dale, and hee 
bringenth an assise and 
recouereth the lande, 
and xx. li. dammages, 
which xx. li. beeynge 
paied, the grauntee of 
the rent sueth his ac­
tyon for x. li. of his 
rent due duringe the 
time of the disseison, 
which if no disseisine 
had ben, he must haue 
had. This is called cir­
cuit of action because it 
might haue ben shortly 

 

aunswered, for where 
as the grauntor should 
receiue xx. li. damages, 
and pay x. li. rent, hee 
might haue receyued 
but the x. li. onely for 
the damages, and the 
grauntee myght haue 
cut of and kept backe 
the other x. li. in hys 
handes by way of de­
tainer for his rent, and 
so there by, mought 
haue saued his action.
 
¶ Clayme.
CLaime is a chal­
lenge vp any man 
of the property or ow­
nershippe of a thinge 
which he hath not in 
possession, but which 
is withholden from 
him wrongfully.
 
¶ Clergie.
CLergie is an aunci­
ent lybertie of the 
Popish church, which 
hath also ben confirmed 

 

with vs in dyuers 
Parliamentes. And it 
is when a Priest, or 
one within holie Or­
ders (as they terme 
it) or any other what 
soeuer, in whom is no 
impediment or impos­
sibilitie to be a Priest, 
is arraigned of felonie 
or such like before a 
temporall Iudge &c. 
and the prisoner pray­
eth his Clergie, that 
is to say, to haue hys 
booke, whych is as 
much as if he desyred 
to bee dismissed from 
the Temporal Iudge, 
and to bee deliuered 
to the Ordinarie to 
purge hymselfe of the 
same offence. Thys 
priuiledge at the first 
was not so generall, 
in respect of the par­
ties that should take 
benefite thereby, as 
it afterwarde became 
to bee, for at the be­
ginnyng, beeynge a 
Popishe inuention, 

 

the Patrons thereof 
were very parcial, and 
woulde not that any 
should reape commodi­
tie thereby, but their 
popish Priestes onely 
and such as were with 
in Orders, as is afore 
saide. And this arose 
amonge them, partly 
through their greate 
pryde, disdaining to be 
vnder the obedience of 
their naturall kinges 
and temporal correcti­
on, and partly of po­
licie, for shame lest the 
lewde maners of their 
spiritualitie, shoulde 
come to the open view 
and examynation of 
the laitie, (as they dis­
tinguish them) and no 
meruail at al, for with 
in a few of the fyrst 
yeares of king Henry 
the seconds raigne, the 
Clergy of the Realme 
had committed aboue 
one hundrede seuerall 
murders vpon his sub­
iectes, as the king was 

 

certeinely informed, 
besides many robbe­
ries and other outra­
ges, for remedie where 
of, order was ta­
ken by the kinge, his 
Nobilitie, and wyth 
much a doe the Cler­
gie consented thereto, 
that if any clerke from 
thence forth commit­
ted Felony or Trea­
son, he should first be 
degraded, and after­
warde deliuered to the 
lay power, there to 
receiue as to his of­
fence belonged &c. at 
the last in fauour of 
life, (a thinge to bee 
shewed indifferentlye 
towards al mankind) 
and for the loue of 
learning, it was gran­
ted to all men that 
coulde reade, though 
they weare neyther 
Priestes, nor within 
orders. And since in 
Parliament made vpon 
good considerations, it 
hath been restrayned 

 

and taken away in di­
uers cases, as in wil­
full murder, burglary, 
and such others.
 
¶ Clerke attaint, 
Clerke conuict.
CLerkes are in two 
sortes, that is to 
say, Clerkes attaint, 
and Clerkes conuict. 
Clerke attaint is hee 
whiche prayeth his 
clergie after iudgement 
gyuen vpon him of the 
felony, and hath hys 
clergie allowed, such a 
clerke may not make 
his purgation. 
 
Clerke conuict is hee 
whiche prayeth hys 
clergie before iudge­
ment geeuen vpon him 
of the felonie, and hath 
his clergy to him gran­
ted, such a clerke may 
make his purgation.
 
¶ Colour.
COlour, is a fayned 
matter which the 

 

defendaunt or tenant 
vseth in hys barre 
when an actyon of 
trespas, or an assise is 
brought against him, 
in which hee gyueth 
the demaundaunt or 
pleintife a shew at the 
first sight that he hath 
good cause of actyon 
wherein troth it is no 
iust cause, but onely a 
color & face of a cause: 
And it is vsed to the in­
tent that the determi­
nation of the actyon 
should be by the Iud­
ges, and not by an ig­
noraunt Iury of xij. 
men. And therefore a 
colour ought to bee a 
matter in law or doubt­
ful to the common peo­
ple, as for example. A. 
brings an assise of land 
against B. & B. saith 
that he himselfe dyd 
let the same land to one 
C. for terme of life, & 
afterward did graunt 
the reuersion to A. 
the demaundment, and 

 

after C. the tenaunt 
for terme of lyfe died, 
after whose decease A. 
the demaundant clay­
ming the reuersion by 
force of that graunt 
(whereto C. the tenant 
for lyfe did neuer at­
turne) entred, vppon 
whom B. entred, a­
gainst whomA. for that 
entre bringes this as­
sise &c. this a good co­
lour because the com­
mon people think that 
the lande wil passe by 
the graunt without 
attournement, where 
in deede it wyll not 
passe &c. 
 
Also in an action of 
trespas colour must be 
geuen, and of them are 
an infinite number, one 
for example: In an ac­
tion of trespas for ta­
kinge awaye of the 
playntifes beastes, the 
defendaunt sayth, that 
beefore the pleyntife 
had anye thynge in 
them, hee himselfe was 

 

possessed of them as of 
his proper goods, and 
deliuered them to A. 
B. to redeliuer them 
to him againe when &c. 
and A. B. gaue them 
vnto the plaintife, and 
the pleintif supposing 
the propertie to be in 
A. B. at the tyme of 
the gift, tooke them, & 
the defendaunt tooke 
them from the pleyn­
tif, whereupon the plain­
tife bringeth an action; 
this is a good colour, 
and a good plea.
 
¶ Colour of office.
COlour of office, is 
alwayes taken in 
the worst part, & sig­
nifieth an act euel don, 
by the countenance of 
an office, and it bea­
rethe a dissemblynge 
face of the right office, 
where as the office is 
but a vaile to the fals­
hoode and the thinge 

 

is grounded vpon vice 
& the office is as a sha­
dowe to it. 
 
But by reason of the of­
fice, & by vertu of the of­
fice are taken alwaies 
in the best part, and 
where the office is the 
iust cause of the thing, 
and the thing is pur­
suing to the office.
 
¶ Collusion.
COllusion is where 
an action is brought 
against another by his 
owne agreement, if the 
plaintife recouer, then 
such recouery is cal­
led by collusion: and 
in some cases the col­
lusion shall bee enqui­
red of, as in a Quare 
impedit, an assise and 
such like: But in a­
uowry, nor in a writ 
of entrie, or any acti­
on personal, the collu­
sion shal not be enqui­
red.

 

¶ Commen law.
COmmon law, is for 
the most part taken 
3. waies, first for the 
lawes of this Realme 
simply without any o­
ther lawe, as custo­
mary lawe, Ciuil law, 
Spirituall lawe, or 
whatsoeuer els lawe 
ioyned vnto it, as when
it is desputed in our 
lawes of Englande, 
what ought of right 
to bee determyned by 
the common lawe, 
and what by the spiri­
tuall lawe, or Admi­
rales Court, or such 
lyke. 
 
Secondly it is taken 
for the kings courtes, 
as the kinges Bench, 
or common place, one­
lye to shewe a diffe­
rence betweene them 
and the base courtes, 
courtes barons, coun­
tie courtes, pipow­
ders, and such like, as 
when a plea of lande 

 

is remoued out of aun­
cient demesne, because 
the lande is franke fee 
and pleadable at the 
common law, that is to 
say in the kings court 
and not in auncien de­
mesne, or in any other 
base court. 
 
Thirdly and moste 
vsually by the common 
law is vnderstood, such 
lawes as were gene­
rally taken and holden 
for lawe before anye 
statute was made to 
alter the same: as for 
example. Tenaunt for 
lyfe, not for yeares, 
were not to be puny­
shed for doing wast at 
the common lawe, tyl 
the statute of Glouces­
ter. cap 5. was made 
which doth geeue an 
action of wast against 
them: But tenant by 
the curtesie, and te­
naunt in dower, were 
punyshable of waste, 
at the common lawe, 
that is to saye, by 

 

the vsuall, and common 
receiued lawes of the 
realme, before the said 
statute of Glocester 
was made.
 
¶ Common.
COmon is the right 
that a man hath to 
put his beastes to pas­
ture, or to vse & occupy 
the ground that is not 
his owne. 
 
And note that there be 
diuers comons, that is 
to say common in grosse, 
common appendant, com­
mon appurtenant, and 
common beecause of 
neighbourhood. 
 
Common in grosse is 
where I by my deede 
graunt to another that 
he shall haue common 
in my lande 
 
Common appendant 
is where a man is seised 
of certaine land, to the 
which he hath common 
in anothers grounde, 
al they that shall bee 

 

seised of that land, shal 
haue the said common 
only for those beastes 
which compreste that 
lande to which it is 
appendaunt excepting 
Geese, Gootes, and 
hogges. 
 
And alwayes this 
common in by prescrip­
tion and of common 
ryght, and it is ap­
pendaunt to erable 
lande onely, and not 
to any other lande or 
house. 
 
Common appurte­
nant is in the same man­
ner as common appen­
dant, but it is with al man­
ner of beastes, as well 
hogges goates & such 
like, as horses, kine, 
oxen, sheepe & such as 
compest the grounde. 
And such common may 
bee made at this day, 
and may bee seuered 
from the land to which 
it is appurtenaunte, 
but soe cannot com­
mon appendaunt. 

 

Common by cause of 
neighborhod, is where 
the tenaunts of two 
lords which be seysed 
of two townes where 
one lyeth nighe ano­
ther, & euery of them 
haue vsed from the time 
whereof no mind run­
neth, to haue comen in the
other towne, with all 
maner of beastes comi­
nable. 
 
But the one may 
not put his cattel in the
others ground, for soe 
they of the other towne 
may distraine them dam­
mage fesaunt, or may 
haue an action of tres­
pas, but they may put 
them into their owne 
feeldes, and if so they 
stray into the feelds of the
other towne, they there 
ought to suffer them. 
And the inhabitants of 
the one town ought not 
to put in as many bea­
stes as they will, but 
hauing regard to the in­
habitants of the other 

 

towne, for otherwise 
it were no good neigh­
bourhoode, vpon which 
all this matter doth 
depend.

"compreste" not found in OED but appears to be "compass, v. a" ("compost"). 


 
¶ Condytion.
COndition is a res­
traint or bridle an­
nexed, and ioyned 
to a thinge, so that by 
the not performance 
or not doinge thereof, 
the party to the condi­
cion shall receiue pre­
iudice and lose, & by 
the performance and 
dooynge of the same con­
modity & aduantage. 
 
And all condityons 
are either condityons 
actuall and expressed, 
which he called con­
ditions in deede, or els 
they bee conditions 
implyed or couert & 
not expressed, which 
are called conditions 
in law. 
 
Also al condytions 
are either conditions 

 

precedent and goinge 
before the estate & are 
executed or els subse­
quent, and following 
after the estate and 
executorie. 
 
The condition pre­
cedent, doth gaine and 
gett the thinge or es­
tate made vpon con­
dition by the perfor­
mance of the same. 
 
The condition sub­
sequent, doth keepe & 
continue the thinge 
or estate made vppon 
condition by the per­
formance of the same 
 
Actuall and expres­
sed condition, which 
is called a condition 
in deede: is a condity­
on knitt and annexed 
by expresse wordes to 
the feoffement, leas, 
or graunt, either in 
writinge or without 
writinge, as it Fen­
feoffe a man in landes 
reseruing rent to be pai­
ed at such a feast vpon 
condition that if that feofee 

 

faile of payment at the 
day, that then it shall 
be lawfull for mee to 
reenter. 
 
Condition implyed 
or couert and not ex­
pressed which is called 
a condition in law, is 
when a man graunteth 
to one the office to bee 
keeper of a parke, ste­
warde, Bedle, bailife, 
or such like, for terme 
of life & though there 
bee no condition at al 
expressed in the graunt, 
yet the lawe speaketh 
couertlye of a condi­
tyon, which is that 
if the grauntee do not 
execute all points ap­
perteyninge to his of­
fice by himselfe or his 
sufficyent deputye, 
then it shall bee law­
full to the grauntour 
to enter and discharge 
him of his office. Con­
dition precedent and 
goinge before is when 
a leas is made to one 
for life vpon condition 

 

that if the lessee for 
life, will paie to the 
lessor xx.li. at such a 
day, that then he shal haue 
fee simple: here that con­
dicion preceeds & go­
eth beefore the estate 
in fee simple, and vppon
the performance of that
condycion, doth get 
and gaine the fee sim­
ple. Condition subse­
quent and followinge 
after, is when one 
graunts to I.S. hys 
manor of Dale in fee 
simple, vpon condity­
on, that the grauntee 
shal pay to him at such 
a day xx.li. or els that his 
estate shal cease, here that
condition is subsequent 
& following the estate 
in fee simple, and vpon 
the performance there 
of, doth keepe and con­
tinue the estate.
 
¶ Confiscate goods.
COnfiscate goods 
are goods to which 

 

the lawe intitleth the 
Queene, when they 
are not claimed by any 
other. As if a man bee 
indited that he feloni­
ously stole the goods of 
I.S. where in truith 
they are hys owne 
goodes, and they are 
brought into the court 
against him as a mai­
neur, & then is demaun­
ded, what he sayth to 
those goods, and he de­
nieth them, nowe by 
this denying of them, 
hee shall loose those 
goods, although that 
afterwarde he be ac­
quited of the felony, and 
soe in other lyke ca­
ses.
 
¶ Contracte.
COntracte is a bar­
gaine or couenaunt 
betweene two parties, 
where one thinge is 
geeuen for an other 
which is called quid 
pro quo, as if I sell 

 

my horse for money, or 
if I couenant to make 
you a lease of my man­
nor of Dale in consi­
deration of xx.li. that 
you shal giue me, these 
are good contracts be­
cause there is one thing 
for an other, But if 
a man make promyse 
to mee that I shall 
haue twentye shyl­
linges, and that hee 
wil be debtour to mee 
thereof, and after I 
aske the xx.s. and 
hee wil not deliuer it, 
yet I shal neuer haue 
any action to recouer 
this xx.s. for that, that 
this promise was no 
contracte but a bare 
promyse, and ex nu­
do practo non oritur ac­
tio: but if any thinge 
were geuen for the xx. 
shillinges though it 
were not but to the 
value of a peny, then 
it had ben a good con­
tracte.

 

¶ Conusance.
COnusance of plee, 
is a priuiledge that 
a citie or Towne 
hath of the kinges 
graunt to holde plee 
of al contractes, and 
of landes within the 
precinct of the fran­
chise: and when anye 
man is impleaded for 
any such thinge in the
Court at Westmins­
ter: the Maior and 
bailifes of such fraun­
ches or theyr attur­
ney may aske conu­
sance of the plee, that is 
to say, that the plee & the mat­
ter shal be pleded & de­
termined before them. 
 
But if the Court 
at Westeminster bee 
lawefullye seised of 
the Plee, beefore 
Conusaunce bee de­
maunded, then they 
shall not haue Co­
nusance for that suit, 
because they haue neg­
ligently surcessed their 

 

time of demaunde, but 
this shal be no barre to 
them to haue conusance
in an other action, for 
they may demaunde 
conusance in one acti­
on, and omit it in an 
other action at theyr 
pleasure. 
 
And note that conu­
sance lyeth not in pre­
scription, but it beho­
ueth to shew the kinges 
letters.
 
¶ Corodie.
COrodie, was a rea­
sonable allowance 
of Meat, bread, drink, 
money, clothing, lod­
ging, and such like sus­
tenance, which of com­
mon right euery foun­
dor of Abbeies, Prio­
ries, Nunries, & other 
houses of religion, had 
in the same house, when
any were standing, for 
his father, brother, co­
sine, or other man that 
hee woulde appoynt 

 

should take it, yf it 
were a house of Mon­
kes, and if hee were 
foundor of a house of 
Nunnes or women, 
then the same for hys 
mother, sister, cosin, or 
other woman that he 
would direct thither, 
and alwaies this was 
prouided for, that he that 
had corodie in a house 
of Monkes, might not 
send a woman to take 
it. Nor where corodie 
was due in a Nunrie, 
there it was not law­
full to appoint a man 
to receiue the same, for 
in both cases, such pre­
sentacion was to be re­
iected. And this Co­
rodie was due as well 
to a common person that
was foundor, as where 
the king him self was 
foundor. But where the
house was holden in 
frankalmoigne, there 
the tenure it selfe was 
a dyscharge of Co­
rodye agaynste all 

 

men. Except it were 
afterward charged vo­
lantarily, as when the 
king would sende hys 
writ to the Abbey for 
a Corodie for such a 
one whom they admit, 
there the house should 
bee charged for euer, 
whether the king were 
foundor or not.
 
¶ Crowner.
CRowner is an aun­
cient officer of trust 
and of great aucthori­
tie, ordeyned to bee a 
princypall conserua­
tor, or keeper of the 
peace, to beare re­
corde of the plees of 
the Crowne, and of 
his owne sight, and 
of dyuers other 
thynges manye in 
number &c. But at 
thys day, eyther the 
aucthorytye of the 
Coroner ys not so 
great, as in foretime 
yt was, where by 

 

the office is not had in 
like estimacion: Or 
els the Sherife and 
those that haue auc­
thoritye to choose the 
Coroner are not so 
careful as they should 
bee in theyr electyon: 
and therefore, it is 
nowe almost come a­
gaine into that plight 
that it was in Kynge 
Edwarde the firstes 
daies, when this sta­
tute followinge was 
made: Forasmuch as 
meane men and vn­
discreete nowe of late 
are commonly chosen 
to the office of coroner 
where it is requisite 
that wise men, lawe­
ful and able should oc­
cupy such offices: It 
is prouided that through 
al Shires sufficient 
men should be chosen 
to bee Coroners out 
of the most wise and 
discreetest Knyghtes 
&c. And although the 
letter of this statute 

 

bee not preciselye ob­
serued: yet at the least 
the entent should be 
followed as nigh as 
mought be, that for the
default of knights gen­
tilmen furnished with 
such qualities as the 
statute setteth downe 
(of which sort there 
be many) might bee 
chosen: with thys 
addicyon that they bee 
vertuous, and goode 
knowne Christians.
 
¶ Corporatyon.
COrporation ys a 
permanent thinge 
that may haue suc­
cession: And is an 
assembly and ioyning 
together of many into 
one felowshippe, bro­
therhoode and minde, 
whereof one is hedde 
and chiefe, the rest are 
the bodye: and thys 
hedde and bodye knytt 
together make the cor-
poration. 

 

And of Corporaty­
ons, some are called 
spirituall, and some 
temporal, and of those 
that are spirituall, 
some are corporations 
of deade personnes in 
lawe, and some other 
wyse, and some are 
by the aucthorytye of 
the Kynge onelye, 
and some haue beene 
of a myxt authorytye, 
and of those that are 
Temporall, some are 
by the aucthorytye of 
the Kynge also, and 
some by the Com­
mon lawe of the 
Realme. 
 
Corporation spiri­
tual and of dead per­
sons in lawe, is where 
the corporatyon con­
sisteth of an Abbot & 
Couent, and these had 
beginning of the king 
and the man of Rome 
when hee had to doe 
here. 
 
Corporation spiritual 
& of able personz in law 

 

is where the corpora­
tion consisteth of a 
Deane and chaptier 
and this corporation, 
had beginninge of the 
Kinge onely. 
 
Corporation Tem­
poral by the Kinge is 
where there is a ma­
ior and comminaltye. 
 
Corporation tem­
porall by aucthoritye 
of the common lawe 
is the assemblye in par­
liament, which con­
sisteth of the Queene 
the hedde of the Cor­
poration, and of the 
Lords spirituall and 
temporal, and the com­
mons of the realme, the
body of the corporatyon.
 
¶ Bodyes politike.
BOdies politike are 
bishops, abbots, pri­
ors, deanes, person of 
a churche & such like 
which haue succession.
 
¶ Coruption of blood.

 

COrruption of blood 
is when the father 
is attainted of felo­
nie or treason, then 
his bloode is sayd to be 
corrupt, by meanes 
whereof his chyldren 
cannot bee heires to 
him nor to any other 
auncestor. And if hee 
were a noble man or 
gentleman before, hee 
and all hys children 
thereby are made vn­
noble and vngentle, 
hauing regarde to the 
nobilitie or gentrie that
they claim by their fa­
ther, which cannot bee 
made whole againe with­
out aucthority of par­
liament.
 
¶ Couenant.
COuenant is an a­
greement had be­
twene two persons, 
where euery of them is 
bounden to the other, 
to performe certein co­
uenants for his part.
 
¶ Couerture.

 

COuerture, is when 
a man & a woman 
are maryed together: 
Now the time of the 
continuaunce of thys 
maryage betwen them 
is called couerture, and 
the wyfe is called a 
woman couert.
 
¶ Couin.
COuin is a secrete 
assent, determined 
in the hartes of two 
or more, to the preiu­
dyce of any other. As 
if a tenaunt for terme 
of life, will secretly 
conspire with an o­
ther, that the other 
shall recouer agaynst 
the tenaunt for lyfe, 
the lande which hee 
holdeth &c. in preiu­
dice of hym in the re­
uersion.
 
¶ Counterplee.
Counterplee, ys 
where one bringeth 

 

an action, and the te­
naunt in hys aun­
swere and plee, vou­
cheth or calleth for a­
nie manne to warrant 
his title, or prayeth 
in ayde of an other, 
which hath better es­
tate then hee, as of 
hym that is in the re­
uersion, or if one that 
is a straunger to the 
action, come & pray to 
be receiued to saue his 
estate, if the demaun­
dant reply thereto, and 
shew cause that hee 
ought not to vouch 
such one, or that he ought 
not of such one to haue 
aide, or that such one 
ought not to be recey­
ued, this plee is called 
a counterplee.
 
¶ Cinque Portes.
CInque Portes, bee 
certeyne Hauen 
Townes, fiue in num­
ber, to whiche haue 
bene graunted longe 

 

since, many liberties, 
(that other Porte 
Townes haue not,) 
and that first in the 
tyme of king Edward 
called the Confessour, 
(who was before the 
Conquest,) and hath 
bene encreased synce 
chiefly in the dayes of 
the ij. Edwardes, the 
first and second (since 
the Conquest) as ap­
peareth in the Booke 
of Domesday, and o­
ther olde Monuments, 
which in this worke 
beeing to long to cyte, 
I meane Brother N. 
to omit, and set you 
here downe the Copie 
of an auncient recorde 
in French, which the 
worshipful our louing 
and very good father, 
Master Iohn Twyne of 
Caunterbury gaue me 
out of his booke called 
W. Biholt, sometyme 
a Monke of the Abbey 
of saint Augustines, 
where in yon shall 

 

learne which were aun­
ciently accompted the 
fyue Portes, and their 
members, what serui­
ces they owe, where 
their Court ought to 
be kept, before whom, 
and of what matters 
they may hold plee, with
such like, worthy to be 
knowen, & therby you 
shall perceiue also that 
the old rude verse doth 
falsely name the fiue 
Portes, in recknyng 
them vp after this sort. 
 
Douer, Sandwicus, 
Rye, Rumney, Frig­
mareuentus. Douer, 
Sandwich, Rie, Rum­
ney, winchelsey, which 
is ment by Frigmare­
uentus, &c. which Re­
corde I will English 
as well as my small

bers aforesaide, ought

saide 5. shipps. 
 
Summe lvij. 
shipps. 
 
When the Kinge 
would haue hys ser­
uice of the aforesayde 
shipps, they shall haue 
xl. dayes summons, & 
they shall finde to the 
king in euery ship xx. 
men, & the Master wel 

 

armed, and well ap­
poynted to doe the 
kinges seruice. 
 
And the shippes shall 
go at the proper costes 
of the Cinque Ports, 
thyther whether they 
shalbee summoned. 
And when the shipps 
are thither come, they 
shal continue xv. daies 
in the kinges seruice, 
at the proper costes of 
the v. ports. And after 
the xv. dayes are past, 
they shalbe at the char­
ges of the K. if he haue 
any thing for them to do 
 
The Master of the ship 
shall take vi. d. a day. 
The Constable vi. d. & 
euery of the other ma­
riners iij. pence. 
 
And it is to be kno­
wen, that the court of 
Shipway, which is the
chief court of the fiue 
Portes, where euery 
Maior of euery port, 
or 12.10.6. or 4. & the 
Maior of euery port, 
as they by letters of 

 

the warden of the Cin­
que portes haue hym 
summoned, and as the 
port is greater or les­
ser, without essoyne 
ought to come, ought 
to be summoned by the 
letters of the sayde 
warden to al the portz 
that ought to doe sute 
there. 
 
And the summons 
ought to be vpon sute 
made to summon any 
commynaltie to aun­
swere to any of any 
plee, contayning 40. 
dayes from the day of 
the receyte of the Let­
ters of the sayde war­
den. 
 
And the foresayde 
Court ought to bee 
summoned chiefely for 
Treason done against 
the kinge or kinges 
for counterfaitinge of 
the kinges seale: or of 
his money, for trea­
sure founde vnder the 
ground: For the kings 
seruice denied, or with 

 

holden, for false Iudg­
ment giuen by any co­
munaltie. 
 
And no commoner 
to any plea agaynst 
him brought shal aun­
swere but at the court 
aforesaid. 
 
And plees there had 
against any Baron of 
the Cinque ports be­
ing challenged by the 
Bailyfe of the same 
port of which the said 
Baron is: ought to be 
adiourned vnto the 
port, wherof the same 
Baron is, (if it be not 
for trespas done a­
gainst the kinge) be­
cause that the sayde 
Barons haue conu­
saunce all manner of 
pleas except pleas of 
the Crown. And when
those Barons haue 
fayled to doe ryght: 
The said warden at 
the complaynt of him 
to whome they haue 
fayled to doe ryght, 
shall goe to the same 

 

port to do right, as is 
contained in the char­
ter. 
 
Moreouer, the afore­
said court ought not 
to be holden from the 
feast of the natiuity of 
saint Mary, vntil the 
feast of saint Andrew, 
because of the martes 
of Germany. 
 
Also when the Ba­
rons of the Cinque 
ports are in the kings 
seruice vpon the Sea, 
or at the kings sum­
mons, or at the kings 
commaundement. 
 
Furthermore, it 
ought not to be holden 
but one day. 
 
And one Essoine on­
lie lyeth in the afore­
sayde Court in euery 
plea. 
 
Of sute no Essoine on­
lie lyeth in the afore­
sayde Court in euery 
plea. 
 
Of sute no Essoine 
lieth, as is before said, 
and therefore if the 
maior, who because 
of sickenesse or other 
sodeyne infirmytye 
cannot come thither, 

 

an other may at that 
daye keepe his place, 
so notwithstandinge 
the returne be made by 
his bailife. 
 
Nor others princi­
pally ought to be char­
ged of any iudgement 
giuen in the same 
court but those names 
who by the Baylifes 
there haue beene re­
turned. 
 
Bisides all thys, 
prouision of Shippes 
and men, as is afore­
saide: I haue seene in 
an other record (short­
lye written ) that e­
uerye Shippe ought 
to haue a boye, which 
there is called Gro­
met: so that in suumme 
the Cinque ports are 
charged with 57 ships 
1197. men , and fif­
tye seuen boies , or 
Gromets.

¶ Damage fesans.
DAmage fesans, 
is when a stran­

 

gers beastes are

grounde, without auc­
thoritie of the lawe, 
or lycence of the te­
naunt of the ground, 
and there doe feede, 
treade, or otherwise 
spoyle the Corne, 
grasse, woods, or such 
like: in which case 
the tenant whom they 
hurt, may therefore 
there take, distrain, & 
impounde them, as 
wel if it be in the night, 
as in the day tyme. 
But in other cases as 
for rent and seruices 
and such like, none 
may distreyne in the 
night season.
 
¶ Danegelde.
DAnegeld, that is 
to be quitt of a 
certaine custome 
which hath runne some 
times, which the danes 
did leuye in Eng­
glande. 
 
This beganne first 

 

in kinge Etheldreds 
daies, who being sore 
distressed by the con­
tinuall iuuasion of the 
Danes, to purchase 
peace was compel­
led to charge hys 
countrey and people 
wyth importable pay­
ments: for hee first 
gaue them at v. seue­
rall paies 113000. li. 
and afterward graun­
ted them 48000. li. 
yerely.
 
¶ Deane and Chapter.
DEane and chapter 
is a body spiritu­
all corporate, consis­
ting of many able per­
sons in law as name­
ly the deane (who is 
the chiefe ) and the 
prebendes, & they to­
gether make the cor­
poratyon. And as 
this corporation may 
ioyntly purchase lands 
and tenementes to the 
vse of their Church 

 

and successours: Soe 
likewise euery of them
seuerally maye pur­
chase to the vse of 
hym selfe and hys 
heires, as wee daylie 
see them doe most a­
bundantly.
 
¶ Declaration.
DEclaratyon is a 
shewinge forth in 
writing, of the griefe 
and complaynt of the 
demaundant or plein­
tife against the tenant 
or defendant, wherein 
he supposeth to haue 
receiued wrong. And 
this declaration ought 
to be plaine & certeine, 
both because it impea­
cheth the defendant or 
tenant, & also compel­
leth him to make aun­
swere thereto.
 
¶ Defendant.
DEfendaunt is hee 
that is sued in an 

 

actyon personal, & hee 
is called tenant in an 
action real.
 
¶ Demaines.
DEmaines, or de­
mesnes, is the lords 
chyefe mannor place, 
which he and his aun­
cestoures haue from 
tyme out of mynde, 
kepte in their owne 
handes, and haue oc­
cupyed the same, toge­
ther with al buildings 
& houses whatsoeuer, 
also the meadowes, 
pastures, woodes, er­
rable lande, and such 
like, belonging there­
unto.

and in an action perso­

 

nall as in an actyon 
of dette, trespas, dis­
ceit, detinue, and such 
other.
 
¶ Halfe bloode.
HAlfe blood, is when 
a manne maryeth a 
wife, and hath issue 
by her a sonne, and 
shee dyeth, and then 
hee taketh an other 
woman, and hath by 
her also a sonne. Now 
these two sonnes are 
after a sort Brothers, 
or as they are termed, 
halfe Brothers, or 
Brothers of the halfe 
blodde, that is to say 
brothers by the Fa­
thers side because they 
had both one father, & 
are both of his bloude 
and not brothers at al 
by the mothers side, 
nor of blodde ne kinne 
that way, & therefore 
the one of them can­
not be heire to other, 

 

for hee that wil claime 
as heire to one by dis­
cent, must bee of the 
whole blodde to him 
from whome he clay­
meth.
 
¶ Demurrer.	 
DEmurrer is when a­
ny action is brought 
and the defendaunt 
pleadeth a plee, to 
which the playntyfe 
sayth that hee wil not 
aunswere, for that, 
that is not a suffy­
cient plee in the lawe, 
and the defendaunt 
sayth to the contra­
ry, that it is a suffi­
cient plee, this doubt 
of the lawe is called 
a demurrer.
 
¶ Denizen.
DEnizen is where 
an alien becommeth 
the Queenes subiecte 
and obtayneth her let­
ters patentes to en­

 

ioye all priueledges as 
an Englishman. But 
yet notwithstanding, 
hee shall paye custo­
mes and dyuers o­
ther thinges as aly­
ens doo &c.
 
¶ Deodande.
DEodande is when 
any man by mys­
fortune is slaine by an 
horse or by a cart, or 
by anie other thinge 
that moueth, then this 
thing that is cause of 
his death, and which 
at the time of the mis­
fortune mooued, shall 
bee forfayte to the 
Queene, and that is 
called deodande, and 
that perteyneth to the 
Queenes Almener for 
to dyspose in almes 
and in deedes of cha­
ritie.

 

¶ Departure from a plea 
or matter.
DEparture from his 
plee or matter, is 
where a man pleadeth 
a plee in barre, and 
the pleyntyfe reply­
eth thereto, and hee 
after in hys reioyn­
der pleadeth or she­
weth an other mat­
ter contrarye to hys 
first plee, that is cal­
led a departer from his 
barre &c.
 
¶ Departure in dispite of 
the Court.
DEparture in dys­
pite of the court, is 
when the tenaunt or 
defendant appeareth to 
the action brought a­
gainst him, and hath a 
day ouer in the same ter­
me, or is called after 
without daye in the 
same terme, & doth not 
appeare, but makes 
defaut, this is a de­

 

parture in the dispite of 
the court, & therefore 
he shalbe condempned.
 
¶ Deputie.
DEputie, is he that oc­
cupieth in an other 
mans right, whether 
it bee office or any o­
ther thing els and his 
forf. or misdemeaner 
shall cause the officer, 
or him whose deputie 
hee is to loose his of­
fice or thinge. But a 
man cannot make his 
deputie in al cases, ex­
cept the graunt so bee 
as if it bee with these 
or such lyke wordes, 
to exercise or vse by 
himselfe or his suffi­
cyent deputye: or if 
the wordes goe fur­
ther by himselfe or 
his deputye, or the 
deputye of his deputy 
then hee may make a 
deputy, and his depu­
tie also may make a de­
putie, els not.

 

¶ Deuastauerunt.
DEuastauerunt bona 
testatoris, is when 
Executours wyl 
deliuer the legacyes 
that their Testatour 
hath geeuen, or make 
restytutyon for wron­
ges done by him, or pay 
hys det due vpon con­
tracts or other detes 
vpon specialties, whose 
dayes of paymentes 
are not yet come &c. 
And keepe not suf­
ficient in their hands to 
discharge those detes 
vpon specyalties that 
they are commellable 
presently by the law to 
satisfie: Then they 
shall bee constrayned 
to paye of theyr owne 
goodes those dutyes, 
which at the first by 
the law they were com­
pelled to pay: accor­
dinge to the valu or that
that they deliuered or 
paied without compul­
sion: for such paimentes 

 

of detes or deliuery of 
legacies, as is afore­
said, before dets paied 
vpon specialties, whose 
daies of paiment ar al­
ready come: are accomp­
ted in the law a was­
tinge of the goods of the 
testator, as much as if 
they had giuen them a­
way without cause, or 
sold them, & conuerted 
them to theyr owne 
vse.
 
¶ Deuise.
DEuise is where a 
man in his testa­
ment geeueth or 
bequeaeth hys goodes 
or his landes to an o­
ther after his decease. 
 
And where such de­
uise is made of goodes, 
if the executours will 
not deliuer the goodes 
to the deuisee, the de­
uisee hath no remedye 
by the common law, but 
it behoueth him to haue 
a citacyon against the 

 

executors of the testa­
tor, to appeare before 
the Ordinary to shew 
why hee perfourmeth 
not the will of the 
testatour, for the de­
uisee maye not take 
the legacye and serue 
himselfe, but it must 
be deliuered to him by 
the executors. 
 
And here to the 
ende to shewe you 
(Brother Nicholas) 
howe much the lawes 
of this Realme, and 
the wise discreet Iud­
ges of the same, who 
are the interpreters 
of the lawe, doe fa­
uour willes, and tes­
tamentes, and so de­
uises in yelding to them
such a reasonable con­
structyon, as they 
thinke might best a­
gree with the mindes 
of the dead, conside­
ringe that willes and 
Testamentes are for 
the most part, and by 
common intendement 

 

made when the testa­
tor is now very sicke, 
weake, & past all hope 
of recouerie, for it is a 
receiued opinion in the 
countrey amonge most 
that if a man should 
chaunce to be so wyse, 
as to make his will in 
his good health when 
he is stronge, of good 
memorie, hath time & 
leasure, & might aske 
counsell if any doubt 
were of the learned, that
then he should not liue 
longe after, and there­
fore they deferre it, to 
such time, when as it 
were more conuenient 
to apply them selues, 
to the dysposicion of 
their soules, then of 
their landes or goodes, 
except it were, that by 
the fresh memorie, and 
recital of them at that 
time, it myght bee a 
cause to put them in 
minde of some of their 
goodes or lands false­
ly gotten, and so moue 

 

them to restitution 
&c. And at that tyme, 
the penninge of such 
willes, are commonly 
committed to the Mi­
nister of the parish, or 
to some other more ig­
norant then he, it that 
may be, who knoweth 
not what woordes are 
necessarie to make an 
estate in fee simple, fee 
taile, for terme of lyfe, 
or such like, besides 
many other mischiefs. 
I will therefore sett 
you here downe some 
of those cases that are 
most common in igno­
rant mens mouthes, & 
do carie by the wise 
interpretacions of the 
Iudges, as is afore­
said, a larger and more 
fauorable sence in wils 
then in deedes: first 
therefore if one deuise 
to I.S. by his will, 
all his landes and te­
nements, here not on­
ly al those lands that 
hee hath in possession 

 

do passe, but also those 
that he hath the reuer­
sion of, by vertue of 
these wordes tene­
ments. 
 
And if lands be de­
uised to a man to haue 
to him for euermore, or 
to haue to him and his 
assignes, in these two 
cases the deuisee shall 
haue a fee simple. But 
if it be geeuen by feffe­
ment in such maner, he 
hath but an estate for 
terme of life. 
 
Also if a man deuise 
his lande to another, 
to geeue, sell, or doe 
therewith at his plea­
sure or will, this is 
fee simple. 
 
A deuyse made to one 
& to his heires males, 
doth make an estate 
taile, but if suche 
woordes bee put in a 
deede of feoffement, it 
shalbe taken in fee sim­
ple, because it doth 
not appeare of what 
bodye the heyres 

 

males shalbe begotten. 
 
If lands be geuen by 
deed to I. T. & to the 
heirs males of his bo­
dy &c. who hath issu a 
daughter, who hath 
issue a sone, and dieth, 
there the land shal re­
turne to the donor, and 
the sonne of the daugh­
ter shal not haue it, be­
cause he can not conuey 
him self by heirs males 
for his mother is a let 
therto: but otherwise 
it is of such a deuise, 
for there the sonne of the
daughter shal haue it 
rather then the wyll 
shall be voide. 
 
If one deuise to an 
Enfant in hys mo­
thers bellye, it is a 
goode deuise, other­
wise it is by feoffe­
ment, graunt, or gift, 
For in those cases 
there ought to bee one 
of habylytye to take 
presently, or other­
wise it is voide. 
 
A deuise made (in 

 

fee simple)without ex­
presse words of heires 
is good in fee simple. 
 
But if a deuise bee 
to I. N. he shall haue 
the lande but for term 
of life, for those wordz 
will carry no greater 
estate. 
 
If one wil that his 
sone I. shall haue his 
land after the deathe 
of his wife, here the 
wife of the deuisour
shall haue the lande, 
first for terme of her 
life. So likewise if a 
man deuise his goodes 
to his wife, and that 
after the decease of his 
wife, his sonne and 
heire shall haue the 
house where the goodes 
are, there the sonne shal 
not haue the house du­
ring the life of the wife, 
for it doth appeare that 
his intent was, that hys 
wife should haue the 
house also for terme of 
her life, not with stan­
ding it were not deuised 

 

to her by expresse 
wordes. 
 
If a deuise be to I. 
N. and to the heires 
females of his bodye 
begotten: after the de­
uisee hath issue a sone 
and a daughter and 
dieth, here the daugh­
ter shal haue the land, 
and not the sonne, and 
yet he is the most wor­
thy person, and heire 
to his father, but be­
cause the will of the 
deade is, that the daugh­
ter shoulde haue it, 
law and conscience wil 
so also. And here­
in the verye heathens 
were precise, as ap­
peareth by those ver­
ses of Octauius Augus­
tus, which Dona­
tus reportethe, hee 
made after that Vir­
gil at his death, gaue 
commaundement that 
his bookes shoulde be 
burnte, because they 
were imperfecte, and 
yet some perswa­

 

ded that they should 
be saued as in deed 
they happily were, to 
whom he aunswered 
thus: but faith of law 
must neds be kept:, & 
what last wil doth say 
 
And what it doth 
commaunde be done, 
that neds we must obay.
 
¶ Discent.
DIscent is in two 
sortes, either lini­
al or collateral. 
 
Liniall discent, is 
when the discent is con­
ueied in the same line of the
whole blood, as grand­
father, father, sonne, 
sonns sonne and soe 
downeward. 
 
Collateral discent, 
is out in an other 
branche from aboue, of 
the whole bloode, as the
graundfathers bro­
ther, fathers bro­
ther, and so downe­
warde.
 
¶ Disclaimer. 


 

DIsclaymer, is 
where the Lorde 
distrayneth hys tenant, 
& he sueth a Repleuin 
& the Lord auoweth the
taking by reason that 
he holdeth of hym, if 
the tenant say that hee 
disclaymeth to hold of 
him, thys is called a 
disclaimer, & if the Lord 
therupon bring a writ 
of right sur disclaimer 
& it be founde agaynst 
the tenaunt, hee shall 
lose the lande.
 
¶ Tythes.
TIthes are in three 
sortes deuyded, to 
witte, Predyal tithes 
Parsonal tithes, and 
Mixt tithes. 
 
Prediall tithes, are 
tithes that be paied of 
thinges that come of 
the grounde onely, 
as Corne, Haye, 
fruites of trees, and 
such like. 
 
Parsonal tithes, are 

 

tithes that bee payed 
of such profits as come 
by the labour and in­
dustrie of a mans per­
son, as by buying, sel­
ling, gaines, of mar­
chandise, and of handy 
craftes men, labou­
rers, & such as worke 
for hyer, as Carpen­
ters, Masons, and 
such like. 
 
Mixt tithes are the 
tythes of Calues, 
Lambes, Pigges, and 
such like, that encrease 
partly of the grounde 
that they be fed vpon, 
and partly of the kee­
ping, industrie, & dili­
gence of the owner.
 
¶ Disperagement. 
*DIsperagement, is 
a shame, disgrace, 
or villany done by the 
Gardein in Chiualry, 
to his ward in chiual­
rie, (which in olde 
time was as much to 
say as a Gentleman) 

 

being within age, by 
reason of maryage. As 
when the Gardeine 
doth marrie his ward 
within the age of xiiij. 
yeares, and within 
such time that he can­
not consent to marry­
age, to a bondwoman, 
or to the daughter of 
one that dwelt in a 
borough, (which is to 
bee vnderstoode suche 
whose fathers professe 
handycraftes, & those 
baser artes of buying & 
sellinge to gett theyr 
lyuing by) or to one 
that hath but one foote 
or one hand, or is lame 
or deformed, or hath 
some horrible disease, 
as the leprosie, French 
pockes, falling sicknes 
or such like, or marieth 
him to a woman that is 
past child bearing, and 
diuers such other: then 
vpon the complaint made 
by the friendes of such 
heire, the Lord or garden 
shal lose the wardship, & 

 

the profits during the 
nonage of the heire, 
for the shame done vn­
to hym.
 
¶ Disseisine.
DIsseisin is when a 
man enters into 
any lands or tenements 
where his entre is not 
lawful, & putteth him 
out that hath the freehold
 
¶ Disseisin vpon disseisin.
DIsseisin vpon dys­
seisin, is when the 
disseisor is disseised by 
an other.
 
¶ Disseisour and disseisee.
DIsseisour, is hee 
which putteth a­
ny man out of his land 
without order of the 
law, and disseasee is he 
that is so put out.
 
¶ Distresse. 


 

DIstres is the thing 
which is taken and 
distreined vpon any land 
for rent behind, or other 
duitie, or for hurt don, 
although that the proper­
tie of the thing belongeth 
to a stranger, but if they 
be beastes that belong 
to a straunger, it beho­
ueth that they be le­
uant and couchant vp 
on the same ground, that
is to say, that the beasts 
haue ben vpon the ground 
certain space that they 
haue them selfe well 
rested there, or els they 
bee not distreynable. 
And if one distrain for 
rent or other thinge 
without cause lawful, 
then the party greeued 
shall haue a Repleuin 
vpon suertie found to 
pursue hys action, and 
shall haue the distres to 
him deliuered againe. 
 
But there be dyuers 
thinges which bee not 
distrainable, that is to say 
an other mans gowne 

 

in the house of a Tai­
lor, or cloth in the house 
of a Fuller, shereman, 
or weyuer, for that, 
that they bee common 
artificers, and that the 
common presumption 
is, that such thinges 
belong not to the Ar­
tificer, but to other 
persons which put them
there to be wrought. 
 
Also vittaile is not 
distraynable, nor corne 
in sheeues, but if they 
be in a cart, for that, 
that a distres ought to 
be alway of such thin­
ges whereof the she­
rife may make Reple­
uin, and deliuer againe 
in as good case as it 
was at the time of the 
takinge. 
 
A man may distraine 
for homage, and fealty 
and escuage, and other 
seruices, & for fines & 
amerciamentes whych 
be assessed in a Leete, 
but not in a Court 
baron. And also for 

 

dammage fesant, that 
is to say, when he fin­
deth the beasts or goods 
of any other, doinge 
hurt or cumbring his 
grounde. But a man 
may not distrain for a­
ny rent or thing due for 
any land, but vpon the 
same land that is charged 
therewith, but in case 
where I come to dis­
trein, & the other seeing 
my purpose, chaseth the
beasts, or beareth the 
thing out to the intent 
that I shall not take it 
for a distres vpon the 
ground, then I may 
wel pursu, & if I take 
it presently in the high 
way or in an others 
ground, the taking is 
lawfull aswell there 
as vpon the land char­
ged to whom soeuer 
the property of the goods be 
Also for fines & amer­
ceaments which be as­
sessed in a leet, one may 
alway take the goods of 
him that is so amerced, in 

 

whose grounde soeuer 
they bee with in the 
Iurisdiction of the 
Court as it is sayde. 
And when one hath 
taken a distresse, it be­
houeth hym to bringe 
it to the common pound 
or els he may keepe it 
in on others grounde 
so that he geue notice 
to the party, that 
hee (if the distresse 
bee a quicke beast) 
may geeue to it foode, 
and then if the beast 
dye for default of foode 
hee that was distrei­
ned shall be at the losse 
and then the other 
may distraine againe 
for the same rent or 
duytye. 
 
But if hee bringe 
the distresse to a holde 
or out of the County, 
that the Sherife may 
not make deliuerances 
vppon the Repleuin, 
then the party vpon the
returne of the sherife, 

 

shall haue a writte of 
Withernam, directed 
to the Sherif, that he 
take as many of hys 
beastes, or as much 
goodes of the other in 
his keeping, tyll that hee 
hath made deliuerance 
of the first distres. Also 
if they be in a forselet 
or castell, the Sherife 
may take with him the
power of the county, 
& beat downe the castel. 
As it appeareth by the
Stature West.I.cap. 
17. Therefore looke 
the Statute.
 
¶ Diuorce.
DIuorce, so called 
of diuorcium, com­
ming of the verbe diuorto
which signifieth to re­
torne backe, as when a 
man is deuorced from 
his wife, he retorneth 
her backe home to her 
father, or other frinds, 
or to the place from whence 
he had her, & by such 

 

dyuorce the maryage 
is defeated and vn­
done.
 
¶ Donor, & donee.
DOnor is he which 
giueth lands or te­
nements to an other in 
taile, and he to whom 
the same is giuen, is 
called donee.
 
¶ Double plea.
Double plee, is where 
the defendaunt or 
tenaunt in any action, 
pleadeth a plee in the 
which ij. matters bee 
comprehended, and e­
uery one by himselfe 
is a sufficyent barre or 
aunswere to the acty­
on, then such a double 
plee shall not be ad­
mitted for a plee ex­
cept one depende vpon 
an other, and in such 
case if hee may not 
haue the last plee with 
out the first plee then 

 

such a double plee shall 
be wel suffered.
 
¶ Right. 
RIght is where one 
hath a thinge that 
was taken from an o­
ther wronfully, as by 
disseisine, or puttinge 
out, or such like. And 
the challenge or claime 
that hee hath, who 
should haue the thing 
is called right.
 
¶ Right of entrie. 
RIght of entrie, is 
when one seised of 
lande in fee, is thereof 
disseysed: Nowe the 
disseisee hath right to 
enter into the lande, & 
may so do when he wil: 
or els hee may haue a 
writ or right against 
the disseisour.
 
¶ Dures.
DUres is where one 
is kept in pryson, 

 

or restrained from his 
liberty contrary to the 
order of the lawe, and 
if such a person so bee­
ing in dures make any 
especialty or obligati­
ion by reason of such 
imprisonment, such a 
deede is voide in the 
lawe: and in an action 
brought vpon such an 
especialty, he may say 
that it was made by 
dures of imprisonment, 
but if a man bee arres­
ted vppon any action, 
at the suit of an other, 
thoughe the cause of 
the action be not good 
nor trewe, if he make 
any obligatyon to a 
straunger beeinge in 
prison by such arrest, 
yet it shall not be said 
by dures, but if hee 
make an obligatyon 
to him at whose suite 
he was arrested to bee 
discharged of such im­
prisonment, then it shal 
be said dures.

 

¶ Eire Iustices.
EIre Iustices, or 
Itinerant as wee 
cal them, were Iusty­
ces that vsed to ryde 
from place to place 
through out the Re­
alme, to adminyster 
Iustice.
 
¶ Embrasour or Embra­
ceour
EMbrasour or Em­
braceour, is he that 
when a matter is in 
trial beetwene partye 
and partye commeth 
to the Barre wyth 
one of the parties (ha­
uinge receyued some 
rewarde soe to doe) 
and speaketh in the 
case, or priuely labo­
reth the Iurie, or stan­
deth there to suruey, 
or ouerloke them, there­
by to put them in feare 
and doubt of the mat­
ter. But men that are 
learned in the lawe, 
may speake in the case, 

 

for their fee, but they 
may not labor the Iu­
rye, and if they take 
money so to doe, they 
also are embrasors.
 
¶ Encrochment.
ENcrochment is said 
when the Lord hath 
gotten seisin or more 
rent, or seruices, of 
his tenaunt, then of 
ryght is due, or ought 
to bee payed or done 
vnto him: As if the 
tenaunt holde his land 
of his Lorde by feal­
tie and ij.s.rent yere­
lye, And nowe of late 
tyme, the Lorde hath 
gotten seisin of iij. shil­
inges rent, or of ho­
mage or Escuage, or 
such like, Then thys 
is called an Encroch­
ment of that rent or 
seruice.
 
¶ Enheritance.
ENheritance is such 
estate in landes, or 

 

tenementes, or other 
things, as may be in­
herited by the heire, 
whether it be of estate 
in fee simple, or tayle, 
by dyscent from a­
ny of hys Auncesters, 
or by hys owne pur­
chase. 
 
And Enheritaunce 
is deuyded into two 
sortes, that is to say, 
enheritance corporate, 
and enheritance incorpo­
rate. 
 
Enheritaunce cor­
porate are mesuages, 
lands, meadowes, pas­
tures, rentes, and such 
like that haue sub­
stance in them selues, 
and may haue conty­
nuance alwaies. And 
these are called corpo­
rall thinges 
 
Enheritance incor­
porate, are aduow­
sons, villaines, waies, 
commons, Courtes, 
fishinges, and such 
like that are, or may be 
appendant, or appurte­

 

naunt to inheritances 
corporate.
 
¶ Equitie.
EQuitie is in two 
sorz, differing much 
the one from the other, 
& are of contrary effec­
tes, for the one doth a­
bridge, diminish and 
take from the letter of 
the lawe. The other 
doth inlarge, amplifie 
& adde thereunto. 
 
The first is thus de­
fined, Equitie is the 
correction of a law ge­
nerally made, in that 
part wherin it faileth, 
which correction of the 
generall wordes, is 
much vsed in our law. 
As if for example, 
when an act of parli­
ament is made, that 
whosoeuer doth such 
a thing, shalbe a felon, 
& shal suffer death: yet 
if a madde man, or an 
infant of yonge yeres 
that hath no dyscreti­
on, doe the same, they 

 

shalbe no felons, nor 
suffer death therefore. 
 
Also if a statute 
were made that al per­
sons that shal receiue, 
or giue meate or drink 
or other succour, to 
any that shal doe such 
a thinge, shal be acces­
sory to his offence, & 
shal suffer death if they 
did knowe of the fact, 
yet notwithstandinge 
one doth such an act, 
and commeth to his 
wife, who knowinge 
thereof doth receiue 
him and giues hym 
meat and drinke, shee 
shal not be accessorye 
nor felon, for in the 
generaltye of the said 
wordes of the lawe, 
he that is mad, nor the
infant, nor the wife 
were included in mea­
ninge. And thus equi­
ty doth correct the ge­
neralty of the law in 
those cases, & the ge­
neral wordes are by 
equity abridged. 

 

The other equitye 
is defined after thys 
sorte: Equity is when
the words of the law 
are effectually directed 
and one thinge onely 
prouided by the wordes 
of the lawe, to the end 
that al thinges of like 
kinde may be prouided 
by the same. And so 
when the wordes e­
nact one thinge, they 
enact al other thinges 
that are of like degree. 
As the statute which 
ordeines that in an ac­
tyon of debt against 
executors, he that doth 
appere by distresse shal 
aunswere, doth extend 
by equity to adminis­
trators, for he of them 
that doth first appeare 
by distresse, shal aun­
swere by equytye of 
the sayd acte, Bee­
cause they are of like 
kinde. 
 
So likewise the sta­
tute of Glocest. geues 
the actyon of wast, and 

 

the paine thereof, a­
gainst him that holds 
for life, or yeares, and 
by the equyty of the 
same a man shall haue 
an actyon of wast a­
gainst him that hol­
deth but for one yeare, 
or halfe yeare, and yet 
that is without the 
wordes of the statute, 
for he that holdeth but 
for halfe a yeare, or 
one yere, doth not hold 
for yeres, but that is 
the meaninge, and the 
words that enact the 
one by equitye, enacte 
the other.
 
¶ Escape.
EScape is in two 
sortes, that is 
to say, volunta­
ry, and neglygent. 
 
Voluntary escape, 
is when one doth arrest 
an other for felony, or 
other crime, & after let­
teth him go where he 
wil, this letting of him 

 

to goe is a voluntarie 
escape. And if the ar­
rest of him that esca­
ped were for felonye, 
then that shal be felo­
ny in him that did suf­
fer the escape, and if for 
treason, then it shalbe 
treason in him, and if 
for trespas, then tres­
pas, & so of other. 
 
Negligent escape, 
is when one is arres­
ted and after escapes 
against the wil of him 
that did so arrest him. 
and is not freshly pur­
sued and taken before 
the pursuer looseth the
sight of him, this shal 
be said a negligent es­
cape, not withstanding 
that hee out of whose 
possession he escaped, 
doe take him after hee 
left sight of him. 
 
There is an escape 
also without arrest, 
as if a murder be made 
in the daye, and the 
murderer be not taken, 
then it is an escape, 

 

for the which the towne 
where the murder was 
done shalbe amerced.
 
¶ Esplees.
ESplees is as it 
were the seysin, or 
possession of a thinge 
profit, or commodity 
that is to bee taken. 
As of a common the 
esplees is the takinge 
of the grasse or common 
by the mouthes of the 
beastes that common 
there: Of an aduowson
the takinge of grosse 
tithes: Of a wood, the 
selling of wood, of an 
orchard the selling of 
Aples or other fruit 
growinge there: of a 
mill the taking of toll 
is the esplees, and of 
such like.
 
¶ Essoine.
ESsoine is where an 
action is brought, & 
the plaintife or defen­

 

dant may not wel ap­
peare at the day in 
court, for one of the 
v. causes vnder expres­
sed, then hee shal bee 
essoined to saue his de­
faut, whereupon note 
well that there bee v. 
maner of essoines, that 
is to say, essoyne de 
ouster le mere, and that 
is by xl. daies, the se­
cond essoine is de terra 
sancta, and that shalbe 
by a yere & a day, and 
these two shalbe layed 
in the beginning of the 
plee. The iii. essoine is 
de male vener, and that 
shalbe at common daies, 
as the action requireth 
and this is called the 
common essoine. The 
iiij. essoine is de malo 
lecti, & that is onely in 
a writte of right and 
there vpon there shall 
a writte go out of the 
Chauncerie, directed 
to the sherife, that hee 
shall send iiii. knights 
to the tenant to see the 

 

tenaunt, and if he bee 
sicke, to geeue him a 
day after a yere and a 
day. The v. essoyne is 
de seruice le roy, and it 
lyeth in al actions, ex­
cept in assise of nouel 
disseisin, writ of dower 
darreine presentment, 
and in appell of mur­
der: but in thys es­
soine, it behoueth at 
the day to shewe hys 
warrant, or els it shal 
torne into a defaut, if 
it be in a plee real, or he 
shal loose xx.s. for the 
plaintifes iorney, or 
more by the discretion 
of the Iustices, if it be 
in plee personall, as it 
appeareth by the sta­
tute of Gloucester. 
cap. 8.
 
¶ Estoppell.
EStoppell is when 
one is concluded, & 
forbidden in lawe to 
speake agaynst hys 
owne acte, or deede. 

 

yea, although it bee to 
say the truth: And of 
estoppells there are a 
great many, one for ex­
ample is, when I. S. 
is bound in an obliga­
tion by the name of 
Thomas Stile, or a­
ny other name, and is 
afterward sued accor­
ding to the same name 
put in the obligation, 
that is to saye Tho­
mas Stile, Nowe hee 
shal not be receiued to 
say that hee is misna­
med, but shalbe driuen 
to aunswere accor­
dinge to the name put 
in the obligation, that 
is to saye T. S. for 
peraduenture the ob­
ligee did not know his 
name, but by the re­
port onely of the obli­
gor himselfe: and in 
as much, as he is the 
same man that was 
bound: he shalbe estop­
ped and forbidden in 
law to say the contra­
rie against his owne 

 

deede: for otherwyse 
hee myght take ad­
uantage of hys owne 
wronge, which the 
lawe will not suffer a 
man to doe. 
 
Also if the daughter 
that is onely heire to 
her father, wil sue ly­
uery with her Sister 
that is a bastarde, shee 
shal not afterward bee 
receiued to say that her 
Sister is bastarde, in 
so much that yf her 
bastarde Sister take 
halfe the lande wyth 
her, there is no remedy 
by law. 
 
Also a man seised 
of landes in fee simple, 
will take a lease for 
yeres of the same land 
of a straunger by deede 
indented, this is an 
estoppell duringe the 
terme of yeares. And 
the lessee is thereby 
barred to saye the 
trouth, for the trouth 
is, that he that lessed 
the land had nothing 

 

in it at the time of the 
lease made, and that 
the fee simple was in 
him that did take the 
lease. But this he shal 
not be receyued to say, 
till after the yeres are 
determined, because it 
appeareth that he hath 
an estate for yeares, & 
it was hys folly to 
take a leas of his owne 
landes, and therefore 
shall thus be punished 
for his folly.
 
¶ Estraungers.
EStraungers are 
they, that are not 
parties nor priuies to 
the leuying of a fine, 
or making of a deede.
 
¶ Estray.
EStray, is where 
any beast or cattel 
is in any Lordshippe, 
and none knoweth the 
owner thereof, then it 
shalbe seised to the vse 

 

of the Queene, or of 
the Lorde that hath 
suche Estray by the 
Queenes graunt, or 
by prescription, and if 
the owner come and 
make clayme thereto, 
within a yere & a day, then
he shal haue it agayne 
paying for his meat, 
or els after the yere, the 
propertie therof shalbe 
to the Lord, so that the lord 
make proclamation ther 
of according to the law, 
in ij. Market townes.
 
¶ Excommunication.
EXcommunication, 
is when a man by 
iudgement in the spy­
ritual Court is accur­
sed, then his is disabled 
to sue any action in the 
Queenes court, and if 
he remaine excommu­
nicate xl. dayes, and 
will not bee iustified 
by hys Ordinarye, 
then the Byshoppe 
shall send hys letter 

 

patent to the Chaun­
cellor, and thereupon 
it shalbe commaunded 
to the Sherife to take 
the bodie of him that 
is accursed, by a writ 
called de Excommuni­
cato capiendo, till hee 
hath made agreement 
with the Church for 
the contempte and 
wronge, and when he 
is iustified and hath 
made agreement, then 
the Byshoppe shall 
sende his letters to the 
Queene, certifiynge 
the same, and then it 
shalbe commaunded to 
the Shirife to dely­
uer hym, by a writte 
called Excommunicato 
deliberando.
 
¶ Exchange.
EXchange, is where 
a man is seised of 
certeine lande, and an 
other man is seysed 
of other lande, if they 
by a deede indented, 

 

or without dede (if the
landes be in one selfe 
county) exhange their 
landes, so that euerye 
of them shal haue o­
thers landes to hym, 
so exchanged in fee, fee 
taile, or for terme of 
lyfe, that is called an 
exchange, and it is 
good with out lyuerie 
and seisine. And in ex­
change it beehooueth 
that the estats to them
limited by the exchang be 
equal, for if one haue 
an estate in fee in hys 
land, & the other hath 
estate in the other lande 
but for terme of life, 
or in taile, then such es­
change is void, but if 
the estates bee equall, 
and the landes bee not 
of equall value, yet 
the exchange is good. 
Also an exchange of 
rent for landes is good 
so an exchaunge bee­
twene rent and com­
mon is good and that 
ought to bee by dede. 

 

And it behooueth al­
way that these words 
(exchange) be in the 
dede, or els nothinge 
passeth by the deede, 
except that he haue 
lyuerie and seisine.
 
¶ Execution.
EXecution is where 
iudgement is gee­
uen in any actyon 
that the plaintife shal 
recouer the lande, the 
debt, or damages, as the
case is, and when the 
writt is awarded to 
put him in possession, 
that is called a writte 
of Execution, & when
he hath the possession 
of the land, or is pay­
ed of the debt, or dam­
mages, or hath the bo­
dy of the defendaunt 
awarded to prison, then
hee hath execution; 
and if the plee bee in 
the County, or court 
baron, or hundred, and 
they deferre the iudge­

 

ment in fauour of the 
partie, or for other 
cause, then the deman­
dant shall haue a writ 
of Executione iudicij. 
But in a writ of debt 
a man shall not haue 
recouerie of any land, 
but of that which the 
defendant hath the day 
of the iudgement yel­
ded. And of chattells 
a man shall haue exe­
cution onelye of the 
chatels which he hath 
the day of execution 
sued.
 
¶ Executour.
EXecutor, is when a 
man maketh hys 
testament and last wil, 
and therin nameth the 
person that shall exe­
cute his testament, then 
he that is so named is 
hys executour, & such 
an executor shal haue 
an action against eue­
rie debtour of his tes­
tatour, and if the exe­

 

cutours haue assetts, 
euery one to whom 
the testatour was in­
debt, shall haue an 
action against the exe­
cutour, if hee haue an 
oblygation or specy­
altie, but in euerye 
case where the testa­
tour myght wage his 
lawe, no action ly­
eth agaynst the exe­
cutour.
 
¶ Extinguishment.
EXtinguishment, is 
where a Lorde of a 
manor, or any other, 
hath a rent going out 
of lande, and he pur­
chaseth the same land, 
so that hee hath such 
estate in the lande as 
hee hath in the rent, 
then the rent is ex­
tinct, for that, that a 
manne may not haue 
rent going out of his 
owne land. And when 
any rent shal bee ex­
tinct, it behoueth that 

 

the lande and the rent 
be in one hande, and al 
so that the estate that 
he hath be not defeasi­
ble, and that he haue 
as good estate in the 
land as in the rent, for 
if he haue estate in the 
lande but for terme of 
life or yeares, & hath 
a fee simple in the rent, 
then the rent ys not 
extinct, but is in sus­
pence for that time, & 
then after the terme the 
rent is reuiued. Also if 
there be Lord, Mesne, 
& tenaunt, & the Lord 
purchaseth the tenan­
cie, then the mesnalty 
is extinct, but that 
mesne shal haue the sur­
plusage of the rent, if 
there be any, as a rent 
secke. Also if a man 
haue a hygh way ap­
pendant, & after pur­
chase the land wherein 
the hygh way is, then 
the way is extinct, & so 
it is of a common ap­
pendant.

 

¶ Extorcion.
EXtorcion is a wrong 
done by an Officer, 
as a Maior, Baylife, 
Sherife, Eschetor, or 
other officer, by colour 
of his office, in taking 
excessiue reward or fee, 
for execution of hys 
saide office or other­
wise, and is no other­
wise, and is no other 
thinge in deede then 
plaine robberie, or ra­
ther more odious then 
robberie, for robberie 
is apparant, and al­
wayes hath with it 
the countenance of vice, 
but extorcion being as 
great a vice as robbe­
rie is, carrieth with it 
a countenance of ver­
tue, by meanes wher­
of, it is the more hard 
to be tryed, or discer­
ned, and therefore the 
more odyous, and yet 
some there be that wil 
not sticke to stretch 
their office, credyte, 
and conscyence, to 

 

purchase money as wel 
by extortion as other­
wise, according to the 
sayinge of the Poet 
Virgil. 
 
What can be told? or 
what is that that hunger 
sweete of golde doth 
not constrayne men 
mortal to attempt?
 
¶ Failing of Record.
FAiling of Recorde, 
is when an action 
of trespas or such like 
is brought against one 
and the defendant say­
eth, that the plaintife 
before thys brought 
an action for the same 
trespasse in an other 
court, & recouered dam­
mage & c. And demaun­
deth iudgement of the 
court, if he shal againe 
haue this action &c. & 
the plaintif saith there 
is no such record, wher 
vpon the defendaunt 
hath a day gyuen him 
to bring in the record, 

 

at which day he fay­
leth, or bringeth in 
suche a one, as is no 
barre to this action, 
then he is said to faile 
of his recorde, & there 
vpon the plaintife shal 
haue iudgement to re­
couer &c.
 
¶ Deede.
DEede is a proofe 
and testimonie of 
the agreement of the 
partie whose deede it 
is, to the thinge con­
tayned in the deede, as 
a deede of feoffement 
is a proofe of the ly­
uerie of seisin: for the 
lande passeth by the li­
uerie of seisine, but 
when the deede and the 
lyuerie are ioyned to­
gether, that is a proofe 
of the liuerye, and 
that the feoffour is 
contented, that the 
feoffee shall haue the 
lande. 
 
And note that all 

 

deedes are either inden­
ted, whereof there bee 
two, three, or more as 
the case requireth, of 
whiche the feoffour, 
grauntor, or lessor hath 
one, the feffee, grauntee, 
or lessee an other, and 
peraduenture some o­
ther bodie also ano­
ther &c. or els they are 
poll deedes or single, & 
but one, which the fef­
fee, grauntee, or lessee 
hath &c. 
 
And euery deede con­
sisteth of iij. principall 
points, (and if those 
iij. be not ioyned toge­
ther, it is no perfect 
deede to binde the par­
ties) namely, writing, 
sealing, and deliuery. 
 
The first point is 
writing, whereby is 
shewed the partyes 
names to the deede, 
their dwelling places, 
their degrees, the thing 
graunted, vpon what 
considerations, thestate 
limitted, the time when 

 

it was graunted, and 
whether simply or vp­
pon condicion, wyth 
other such like circum­
stances. But whether 
the parties vnto the 
deede, writ in the ende 
their owne names, or 
set therto their marks 
(as it is commonlye 
vsed,) it maketh no 
matter at all (as I 
thinke) for that is not 
ment where it is said, 
that euery deede ought 
to haue writing. 
 
The second poynt is 
sealinge, which is a 
farther testimonie of 
their consents to that 
contayned in the deede 
as it appereth by these 
wordes. In witnesse 
whereof &c. alwayes 
put in that later end of 
deedes, without which 
woordes the deede is 
insufficient. 
 
And because we are 
about sealing and sig­
ning of deedes, it shal 
not be amisse (brother 

 

Nicholas) here to 
shewe you, for anti­
quities sake, the ma­
ner of signinge and 
subscribinge of dedes, 
in our auncestours the
Saxons times, a fa­
shion different from that
wee vse in these our 
daies, in this that they 
to their deeds subscri­
bed their names (com­
monlye addinge the 
signe of the crose) and 
in the end did sett 
downe a great num­
ber of witnesses, not 
vsinge at that time a­
ny kinde of seale. And 
wee at this day for 
more suerty, both sub­
scribe our names (al­
though that bee not 
verye necessarye as I 
haue aforesayde) put 
to our seales, and 
vse the helpe of testy­
mony besides. 
 
That former fashi­
on contynued through 
out, vntill the time 
of the conquest by the 

 

Normans, whose ma­
ner by litle & litle at the
length preualed amongst 
vs, for the first sealed 
Charter in Englande 
is thought to be that 
of kinge Edward the 
confessor to the abbey of 
Westminster who (beinge 
brought vp in Nor­
mandy) brought into 
this realme that, and 
some other of their gui­
ses with him: And af­
ter the comminge of 
William the conqueror, the
Normanz liking their 
owne country customs 
(as naturally all na­
tions do) reiected the 
maner that they found 
here, and retened their 
owne, as Ingulphus the
Abbot of Croilande, 
who came in with the 
Conquest witnesseth 
saiynge: The Nor­
mans doe change the 
makinge of writings 
which were woont 
to bee fyrmed in Eng­
lande withe Crosses 

 

of Golde, and other 
holie signes, into the 
printing waxe, & they 
reiect also the manner 
of the English wry­
ting. Howbeit thys 
was not done all at 
once, but it encreased 
and came forwarde by 
certeine steps and de­
grees, so that first and 
for a season, the kings 
onely, or a fewe other 
of the Nobilitie be­
sides him vsed to seale. 
Then the Noble men 
for the most part, and 
none other, whiche 
thinge a man may see 
in the Historie of 
Battell Abbey, where 
Rycharde Lucy chiefe 
Iustice of Englande, 
in the time of kynge 
Henry the seconde is 
reported to haue bla­
med a meane subiect, 
for that he vsed a pry­
uate seale, when as 
that pertained (as he 
sayde) to the kinge 
and Nobilitie onely. 

 

At which tyme also 
(as I. Roste noteth it) 
they vsed to ingraue 
in their seales, their 
owne pictures, & coun­
terfaits, couered with 
a long coate ouer their 
Armours. But after 
this the Gentlemen of 
the better fort tooke vp 
the fashion, and bee­
cause they were not al 
warriours, they made 
seales ingrauen wyth 
their seuerall Coates, 
or shyeldes of armes, 
for difference sake, as 
the same aucthour re­
porteth. At the length, 
about the time of king 
Edwarde the thirde, 
seales became very co­
mon, so that not onely 
suche as bore armes 
vsed to seale but other 
men also fashioned to 
them selues signets of 
their owne deuyse, 
some takinge the let­
ters of their owne 
names, some flowers, 
some knottes and flo­

 

rishes, some birdes, or 
beastes, and some o­
ther thinges, as wee 
now yet daily beholde 
in vse. Some other 
maner of sealinge be­
sides these haue bene 
hearde of amonge vs, 
as namly that of king 
Edward the thirde 
by which hee gaue to 
Norman the hunter, 
the hop and the hop­
towne, with all the 
boundes vpside downe, 
and in witnesse that 
it was sooth, hee bitt 
the waxe with hys 
fore tooth. 
 
The like to this 
(Brother Nicholas) 
our reuerend and good 
father, amonge other 
antiquities seruinge 
my purpose, shewed 
me in a lose paper, but 
not very auncientlye 
writen, and therefore 
he willed me to esteme 
of it as I thought 
good, it was as fol­
loweth. 

 

I Willyan Kinge 
geue to thee Powlen 
Royden, my hop and 
my hoplandes, with 
the boundes vp and 
downe, from heauen 
to earth, from earth 
to hell, for thee and 
thine to dwel, from me 
and mine, to thee and 
thine, for a bow and a 
brode arrow, when I 
come to hunt vppon 
Yarrow. In witnesse 
that this is soothe, 
I bite this waxe with 
mye tooth, in presence 
of Magg, Maude, 
and Margerye, and 
my thirde sonne Hen­
rye. 
 
Also that of Alberic 
de Veer, conteyning 
the donation of Hat­
field to the which hee 
affixed a short blacke 
hafted knife, like vn­
to an olde halfepenny 
whittle, insteede of a 
seale, with diuers 
such like. But some per 
aduenture wil thinke 

 

that these were recei­
ued in common vse & 
custome, and that they 
were not rather the de­
uises & pleasures of a 
few singuler persons, 
such as are no lesse de­
ceiued, then they that 
deme euery charter & 
writinge that hath no 
seale annexed, to be as 
auncient as the Con­
quest, whereas in dede 
sealinge was not co­
monly vsed, til the time 
of Kinge Edward the 
third, as hath bene al­
ready saide. 
 
The third point is 
deliuerye, which all­
though it be set last, 
is not the least, for af­
ter that a dede be wri­
ten, and sealed, if it be 
not delyuered al the 
rest is to no purpose. 
 
And this deliuerie 
ought to be done by the
party him selfe, or his 
sufficient warraunt, 
and so it shall bynde 
him whosoeuer wrote 

 

or sealed the same, and 
by this last acte the 
dede is made perfecte 
accordinge to the in­
tent and effect thereof 
and therefore in deeds 
the delyuerie is to bee 
proued & c. So thus 
you see, that writinge 
and sealinge without 
delyuerie, is nothinge 
to purpose. That sea­
linge, and delyuerie 
where there is no wri­
tinge, worketh no­
thinge, nor writinge 
and delyuery without 
sealinge also maketh 
no dede. Therefore 
they al ought iointlye 
to concurre to make a 
perfect dede, as is be­
fore saide.
 
¶ Farme or ferme.
FArme or ferme, is 
the chiefe mesuage 
in a village, or towne, 
and therto beelonging 
great demeasnes of al 
sortes, and hath bene 

 

vsed to be let for terme 
of lyfe, yeares, or at 
will. 
 
Also the rent that 
is reserued vpon such 
or like leases, is called 
farme, or ferme. 
 
And farmor, or fer­
mour is hee that oc­
cupyeth the farme, or 
ferme, or is lessee 
thereof. 
 
Also in some pla­
ces, and counties eue­
ry lessee, for life, yeres, 
or at will, although 
it be of neuer so smal a 
cottage or house, is 
called farmor, or fer­
mour. 
 
And note that they 
are called farmes, or 
fermes, of the Saxon 
worde Feormian, which 
signifieth to feede, or 
yeelde victuall. For 
in the auncient time, 
their reseruatons were 
as well (or for the 
more parte) in vic­
tualles, as money, vn­
til at the last, and that 

 

chiefely in the tyme 
of Kinge Henry the 
first (by agreement) 
the reseruation of vic­
tualles, was tour­
ned into ready mo­
ney, and so hitherto 
hath continued among 
most men.
 
¶ Fee farme.
FEe farme is when 
a tenaunt holdeth 
of his lord in fee sim­
ple, payinge to him 
the value of halfe, or 
of the thirde, or of the 
fowerth part or of o­
ther part of the land, 
by the yeare. And hee 
that holdeth by fee 
ferme, ought to doe 
no other thinge then 
is conteyned in the 
feoffement, but one­
ly fealtie, for that be­
longeth to al kinde of 
tenures.
 
¶ Feoffement.

 

FEffement is where 
a man geueth lands 
to an other in fee sim­
ple, and delyuereth 
seisin and possession of 
the lande that is a fe­
offement.
 
¶ Feffor, and Feffee.
FEoffor is he that in­
feffeth, or maketh a 
feoffement to an other 
of landes, or tene­
mentes, in fee simple. 
And feoffee is hee, who 
is infeffed, or to whom 
the feoffement is so 
made.
 
¶ Fireboote.
FIreboote is neces­
sary wood to burne, 
whiche by the com­
mon lawe, lessee for 
yeres, or for life, may 
take in his grounde, 
although it bee not 
expressed in his lease: 
and although it bee a 
lease by woorde onely 

 

without writynge: 
But if hee take more 
then is needeful, he shal 
be punished in wast.
 
¶ Fledwite
FLedwite, that is to 
bee quyte from a­
mercements when an 
outlawed fugitiue com­
meth to the kinges 
peace of hys owne 
will, or beinge ly­
cenced.
 
Flemeswite.
FLemeswite, that is, 
that you may haue 
the cattel, or amerce­
ments of your man or 
fugitiue.

"Flemeswite" not found in OED. 


 
¶ Fletwit.
FLetwit (or Flit­
wit) that is to bee 
quite from contention 
and conuicts, and that 
you maye haue plea 
thereof in your court 

 

and the amercements, 
for (Flit) in English 
is Tensone in french.

"Fletwit" or "Flitwit" not found in OED. 


 
¶ Forstall.
FOrstall, that is to 
bee quite of amer­
cementes and cattels 
arrested within your 
lande, and the amer­
cements thereof com­
ming.
 
¶ Forstaller.
FOrstaller is he that 
buieth Corne, Cat­
tell, or other Mar­
chaundize whatsoe­
uer is salable, by the 
way as it commeth 
to markets, faires, or 
such like places to bee 
sold to the intent that 
he may sel the same a­
gaine at a more high 
and deere price in pre­
iudice and hurt of the 
common wealth and 
people &c. 
 
The paine for such 

 

as are conuicte thereof 
&c. is the first tyme, a­
mercement, and losse 
of the thing so bought, 
the seconde time iudg­
ment of the pillorye: 
The third time impri­
sonment and Raun­
some: The fowerth 
time abiuration of the 
towne &c.
 
¶ Franches Royal.
FRanches Royal, is 
where the Queene 
graunts to one and to 
his heires, that they 
shalbee quite of tolle, 
or such like.
 
¶ Free mariage.
FRee maryage, is 
when a man seised 
of landes in fee simple, 
gyueth it to an other 
man, and to his wyfe 
(who is the daughter 
Sister or otherwise of 
kinne to the doner) in 
free mariage, by vertue 

 

of which words they 
haue an estate in spe­
cyall tayle, and shall 
hold the lande of the 
donour quite of al ma­
ner of seruyces vntil 
the fowerth degree be 
past accomptinge them
selues in the first de­
gree except fealtye, 
which they shall doe 
because it is incy­
dent to all tenures sa­
uinge free almes. And 
such gift may be made 
as wel after mariage 
solempnised as before. 
And a man may geue 
landes to hys sonne 
in free mariage, as 
well as to hys daugh­
ter by the opynyon 
of Master Fitzherbert 
in hys writt of cham­
pertye. H. But it 
appeareth otherwyse 
in Master Lyttleton, 
and in Master Brooke 
titulo Frankemarry­
age Placito decimo. And 
so it was holden clere 
in Graies Inne in lent 

 

Anno 1576. 18. Eliz. 
by the right worship­
full master Rhodes them
reader there.
 
¶ Freeholde.
FReehold is an es­
tate that a mann 
hath in landes or 
tenementes, or profite 
to be taken in fee sim­
ple, taile, for terme of 
his owne life, or for 
terme of an others life 
And vnder that, there 
is no free hold: for he that
hath estate for yeares 
or holdeth at wil hath 
no free hold: but they 
are called chattels. 
 
And of free holdes 
there are two sortes 
that is to say, freehold 
in deede, and freeholde 
in lawe. 
 
Freeholde in deede, 
is when a mann hath 
entred into landes, or 
tenementes, and is 
seased thereof really, 
actuallye, and in deede 

 

As if the father seised 
of lands or tenements 
in fee simple dieth, and 
his sonne entreth into 
the same, as heire to 
his father, then he hath 
a freehold in deede by 
his entry. 
 
Freeholde in lawe, 
is when landes or te­
nementes, are dysen­
ded to a man and hee 
may enter into them 
when he wil, but hath 
not yet made his en­
try in deede, as in the 
case aforesaid, if the fa­
ther beinge seysed of 
landes in fee simple die 
seised, and they discend 
to his sonne, but the 
sonne hath not yet en­
tred into them in deede, 
nowe beefore his en­
trie hee hath a freehold 
in lawe.
 
¶ Freshsuit.
FReshsuit, is when 
a man is robbed, and 

 

the partye so robbed, 
followeth the felon 
immediatlye, and ta­
keth him wyth the 
manner, or otherwise, 
and then bringeth an 
appeale against him & 
doth conuince him of 
the felony by verdict, 
which thinge beinge 
inquyred of for the 
Queene and found, the 
party robbed shal haue 
restitution of his goods 
againe. 
 
Also it maye bee 
sayde that the partye 
made freshesuite al­
though he take not the 
theefe presently, but 
that it be halfe a yere, 
or a yeare after the 
robbery done, before 
hee bee taken: if so bee 
that the partye rob­
bed do what lyeth in 
him, by dylygent in­
quiry and searche to 
take him, yea, and al­
though hee bee taken 
by some other body, 

 

yet this shal be saide 
freshesuite. 
 
And so freshsuit is 
when the lord com­
meth to distreine for 
rent or seruice, and the
owner of the beastes 
doth make rescous, & 
driueth them into o­
thers grounde that is 
not holden of the lord, 
and the lord followeth 
presently and taketh 
them, this is called 
fresh suit, and so in o­
ther like cases.
 
¶ Gager of deliuerans.
GAger of deliuerans 
is where one sueth 
a repleuin of goodes 
taken, but he hath not 
delyuery of the goods 
and the other auow­
eth, and the plaintife 
sheweth that the de­
fendant is yet seised 
&c. and praieth that the
defendant shall gage 
the delyuerance, then 
he shal put in suertye 
or pledges for the rede­

 

liuerance, and a wryt 
shall go foorth to the 
Sherife for to redeli­
uer the goodes &c. But 
if a man claime proper 
tie, he shal not gage the
deliuerance. Also if he 
say that the beastes bee 
dead in the pound, hee 
shal not gage &c. Also 
a man shall neuer gage 
the deliuerance before 
that they be at issue, 
or demurrer in the 
lawe.
 
¶ Warde. 
WArde, is when an 
infant whose aun­
cestor held by knights 
seruice, is in the ward 
or keeping of the Lord 
of whom those landes 
were holden. And if 
the tenant hold of dy­
uers Lordes dyuers 
landes, the Lord of 
whom the land is hol­
den by prioritie, that 
is to say, by the more 
elder tenure, shal haue 

 

the wardshippe of the 
infant, but if one te­
nure be as olde as the 
other, then he that first 
happeth to haue the 
warde of the body shal 
keepe it, but in that 
case euery Lord shall 
haue the warde of the 
land that is holden of 
him, but if the tenant 
hold of the Queene in 
chiefe, then she by her 
prerogatiue shal haue 
the ward of the bodie, 
and of al the land that 
is holden of her, & of 
euery other Lord.
 
¶ Wardeine.
WArdein most pro­
perly is he that 
hath the wardship or 
keeping of an herre, & 
of lande holden by 
knightes seruice, or of 
one of them to his owne 
vse, during the nonage of 
the heire, & within that 
time hath the bestowing 
of the bodie of the heires 

 

in maryage at his ple­
sure, without disper­
agement. 
 
And of Wardeines 
there be ij. sorts, name­
ly, gardein in ryght, & 
gardein in deede. 
 
Gardein in right is 
he that by reason of his 
seigniorie is seised of 
the wardship or kee­
ping of the lande, & of 
the heire, during the 
nonage of the heire. 
 
Gardein in deede, is 
where the Lord after 
his seisin, as aforesaid, 
graunteth by deede or 
wythout deede, the 
wardship of the land, 
or of the heire, or of 
both to an other, by 
force of which graunt 
the grauntee is in pos­
session, then ys the 
grauntee called gardein 
in deede. 
 
And this gardein in 
deede may graunt the 
heire to another also, 
but that other is not 
properly called garden 

 

in deede for that is the 
grauntee of the Gar­
den in right onely, and 
here you may see (bro­
ther Nicholas) what 
miserye followeth the
tenure by knightes 
seruice if the tenaunt 
dyeth leauinge hys 
heire within age, how 
the poore childe may 
bee tossed, and tum­
bled, chopped and chan­
ged, bought and sold 
like a Iade in Smith 
fielde, and that more 
is married to whom 
it pleaseth his garden, 
whereof ensue manye 
euells.
 
¶ Warninge. 
Warning is when
an actyon of de­
tinue of charters is 
brought against one, & 
the defendant saieth, that
the charters were de­
liuered to him by the 
plaintife, and by an o­
ther vpon certein condi­

 

tions, and praiethe that
the other may be war­
ned to pleade with the 
plaintife whether the 
conditions be perfo­
med or noe, and there­
vppon a write of Scire 
facias shall goe forthe 
against him. And that 
is called warninge.
 
¶ Gauelate.
GAuelate, is a specy­
all and auncyent 
kinde of Cessauit vsed 
in Kent where the cus­
tome of Gauelkinde 
continueth: whereby 
the tenant shal forfait 
his landes and tene­
ments, to the lord of 
whom they are holden 
if he withdrawe from 
his lorde his due rents 
and seruices, after 
thys manner as fol­
loweth. 
 
If any tenaunt in 
Gauelkinde, with­
holde hys rent, & his 
seruices of the tenement 

 

which hee holdeth of 
his lord, let the Lorde 
seeke by the awarde of 
his Court from three 
weekes to iij. weekes, 
to find soe distres vpon
the tenements vntil the
iiij. court, alwaies with
witnesses. And if within 
that time, he can finde 
no distres in that te­
nement, whereby hee 
may haue iustice of his 
tenaunt. Then at the 
fowerth court let yt 
be awarded, that hee 
shal take the tenement 
into his hande, in the 
name of a distres, as if 
it were an oxe or a cow 
& let him kept it a yere 
& a day in his hand with­
out manuring it: within 
which terme if the te­
naunt come & pay hys 
arrerages, & make rea­
sonable amendes for the
withholding, then let him 
haue & enioy his tene­
ment as his auncestors 
& he before held it: & if 
he do not come before 

 

the yeare and the day 
paste, then let the 
Lord goe to the next 
Countie court wyth 
the witnesses of hys 
owne Court, and pro­
nounce there this pro­
cesse, to haue further 
witnesse, and by the a­
warde of hys Court, 
(after the Countie 
court holden) he shall 
enter and manure in 
those lands and tene­
ments as in his owne. 
And if the tenaunt 
come afterwarde, and 
will rehaue his tene­
ments, & hold them as 
he did before, let hym 
make agreement wyth 
the Lord, according as 
it is aunciently said. 
 
Hath he not since any 
thing gyuen, nor hath 
he not since any thing 
paied: Then let hym 
pay fyue pounde for 
hys were er before hee 
beecome tenaunt or 
holder againe. 

 

There bee some co­
pies that haue the first 
Verse thus written. 
 
Nisith yelde, and nisith 
gelde. 
 
And others thus. 
 
Nighesith yelde, and ni­
ghesith gelde. 
 
But these differ not 
in signification, other 
copyes haue it after 
this sort. 
 
Nigondsith felde, and 
nigondsith gelde. 
 
That is to say, let 
him ix. times pay, and 
ix. times repay.
 
¶ Gauelkinde.
GAuelkind is a cus­
tome annexed, and 
going with landes in 
Kent called gauelkind 
lands, holden by aun­
cient Socage tenure, 
And is thought by the
skilfull in Antiqui­
ties, to be called Ga­
uelkind of Gyue al 
kyn, that is to say, to all 
the kindred in one line 

 

according as it is vsed 
among the Germans, 
from whom we Eng­
lishmen, and chiefly of 
Kent come. Or els it 
is called Gauelkind of 
gyue all kinde, that is 
to say, to all the male 
children, for kinde in 
Dutch signifyeth a 
male childe. And dy­
uers other like coniec­
tures are made by them
of the name (Gauel­
kind) which I omyt 
of purpose for short­
nes sake, because that 
here you looke (Bro­
ther Nicholas) as you 
desired me, that I should 
speak somewhat large 
ly conerninge other 
more needeful matters 
for your purpose, 
which you ar desirous 
to know as touching 
Gauelkind lands, both 
because you were born 
in Kent, & also are most 
abyding there, & there 
fore you thinke to bee 
ignorant of the maners 

 

or cust. of your natiue 
contry were a foul shame 
 
To satisfie your re­
quest in this: I haue 
therefore set you here 
downe, the auncyent 
customes of Kent, 15 
they haue very truely 
& carefully of late ben 
published, with some ca­
ses vpon them, gathe­
red out of those bookes 
that make any mencion 
hereof, which wyll I 
think content your de­
sire at full. And first 
you must know, that 
these Gauelkind cus­
tomes are of good an­
tiquitie, brought in 
hither by the Saxons, 
Intes, and Angles 
Germans, from whom 
we Englishmen dys­
cend (as is aforesaid) 
& were by them vsed, 
& left here, & so conti­
nued in force, vntyll 
Willyam Duke of 
Normandie, con­
quered all Englande, 
(Kent onely excepted) 

 

which he had by com­
posicion & not by con­
quest. And in this com­
posycion the valiant 
Kentishmen obtayned 
a graunt of the conty­
nuation of their cus­
tomes of Gauelkinde, 
which euer since they 
haue vsed in the same 
countrey, & thus they 
are as followeth. 
 
¶ The Customes of Kent 
 
THese are the vsa­
ges & customes, the 
which the comminalty 
of Kent claymeth to 
haue in the tenements 
of Gauelkind, & in the 
men of Gauelkind, al­
lowed in Eire before 
Iohn of Berwicke & 
his Compainions the 
Iustices in Eire in 
Kent, the xxj. yere of 
kind Edw. the sonne 
of king Henrie. 
 
That is to say, that 
all the bodies of Ken­
tishmen be free aswell 

 

as the other free bo­
dyes of England. 
 
This thing hath ben 
since confessed to bee 
true, as it appeareth in 
30. E. I. in Fitzherbert 
titulo Villenage pla­
cito 46. Where it is 
holden sufficient for a 
man to auoyde the ob­
iection of bondage, to 
say that hys father 
was borne in Kent. 
But whether it wyll 
serue in that case to say, 
that him selfe was borne 
in Kent, it is (for good 
reason) to be doubted. 
 
2  And that they ought 
not the Eschetour of 
the king to chose, nor 
euer in any time dyd 
they. But the kinge 
shall take or cause to 
be taken such a one as 
it shall please him, to 
serue him in that which 
shalbe needefull. 
 
3  And that they may 
their lands & their te­
nements gyue and sel, 
without licence asked 

 

of their Lordes: Sa­
uing vnto the Lordes 
the rents & the seruy­
ces due out of the same 
tenements. 
 
4  And that all, and 
euery of them, may by 
writ of the king, or by 
plaint, pled for the ob­
tayning of their right, 
aswell of their Lordes 
as of other men. 
 
5  And they claime al­
so, that the comminaltie 
of Gauelkinde menne 
which hold none other 
then tenements of ga­
uelkind nature, ought 
not to come to the co­
mon summons of the 
Eire, but onely by the 
Borsholder, & iiij. men 
of the Borough. Ex­
cept the towns which 
ought to aunswere by 
xij. men in the Eire. 
 
The like to this pri­
uiledge is enioyed at 
this day in the She­
rifs Lathe, where ma­
ny whole borows, be 
excused by the onely 

 

appearance of a Bor­
sholder, and two, fow- 
er, or fixe other of the 
inhabitants. Borshol­
der is so named of the 
Saxon wordes Bor­
her ealder, that is to 
say, that most auncient or 
elder of the pledges. 
 
6 And they clayme 
also, that if any tenant 
in gauelkind bee at­
tainted of felonye, for 
the which he suffereth 
iudgement of deathe, 
the kinge shal haue al 
his goods, & his heire 
forthwith after hys 
death shal be enherita­
ble to al his landes & 
tenements which he held 
in Gauelkind in fee, 
& inheritance: And he 
shal hold them by the 
same seruices & cus­
tomes, as his aunces­
tors helde them: where­
vpon it is said in kentish 
The father to the bough, 
And the son to the plough.
But this rule holdeth 

 

in case of felonye, and 
of murder onelye, and 
not in case of treason 
at all: And it hol­
deth also in case wher 
the offendour is ius­
tised by order of lawe 
and not where he with­
draweth him selfe af­
ter the fault commit­
ted, and wil not abide 
his lawfull trial. And 
because that this cus­
tome shal not be con­
strued by equity but 
by a straight and lite­
ral interpretacion: it 
hath therefore beene 
doubted, whether the 
brother or vncle shall 
haue the aduantage 
thereof, beecause the 
words extent to the 
sonne onely. 
 
See 22. E. 3. a­
bridged by master Br. 
titulo Custome 54. 
 
7  And if he haue a 
wife, forthwith be she 
endowed by the heire, 
if he be of age, of the 
one halfe of al the lands 

 

and tenements which 
her husband helde of 
Gauelkind nature is 
fee: To haue & to hold 
according to the forme 
hereafter declared, and 
of such lands the king 
shal not haue the yere, 
nor wast, but onely the
goods, as is before said. 
 
The wife shall not 
lose her dower for the 
defaut of her husband, 
but in such case where 
the heire shal lose hys 
inheritance for the offence 
of his father. 8. H. 3. 
 
8  And if any man of 
Gauelk. either for fe­
lonie, or for suspicion of 
felony, withdraw him out 
of the countrey, & be deman
ded in the county as he 
ought, & be afterward 
vtlawed, or put him self 
into the holy church, and 
abiure the land, & the 
Realme, the king shal 
haue the yere & the wast 
of his lands, & of al his 
tenementz, together withal 
his goodes & chattels. 

 

So that after the yere 
and the day, the nexte 
Lord, or Lordes, shall 
haue their Eschetes of 
those lands, and tene­
ments, euery lord that 
which is immediatly 
holden of him. So is 
it holden in the bookes 
8.  E. 2. abridged by 
master Fitzh. titulo Pre­
scription 50. et 22. E. 
3. abridged by master 
Brooke titulo Custome 
54. 
 
9  And they clayme 
also, that if any te­
naunt in Gauelkind 
die, & be an inheritor of 
landes, and tenements 
in Gauelkind, that all 
his sonnes shall part 
that inheritance by e­
qual porcions. 
 
10  And if there bee 
no heire male, let the 
particion be made be­
tweene the females, 
euen as betwene bro­
thers. But the statute 
of Prærogatiua regis ca. 
16. sayeth, That the 

 

females, shall not de­
uide with the males, 
which is to be vnder­
stoode, or such as bee in 
equal degree of kinred 
as brothers & sisters, 
as in this ix. and x. de­
uision. For if a man 
haue issue iij. sonnes, & 
the eldest haue issue a 
daughter, and die in the
life of his father, & the 
father dyeth. In this 
case the daughter shal 
ioine with the two other 
brethren her vncles, for 
that she is not in equall 
degree with them, as 
her father was, whose 
heire neuerthelesse shee 
must of necessity be. 
 
11  And let the messu­
age also be departed be­
twene them, but the As­
ter shal remaine to the 
yongest sonne or daugh­
ter, & be the value there­
of deliuered to each of 
the parceners of the 
heritage, from xl. feete 
from that Astre, if 
the tenement will it 

 

suffer. 
 
By this worde (As­
ter) is ment ) as is con­
iectured) eyther the 
hall or cheefe roome of 
the house, eyther else 
the wel for water, or 
the south side of the 
buildinge, for (Astre) 
beeing sounded with­
out (s) may come of 
the latin worde Atri­
um, which signyfieth 
a Hall, or of Haus­
trum, which betoke­
noth the bucket of a 
well, or of Austrum, the 
south side, euery of 
which haue their par­
ticuler commodityes 
aboue the rest of the 
house or tenement, Or 
otherwise being soun­
ded with (s) it may 
bee deduced from the 
french word (Asister) 
by contractyon (As­
tre) which is as much 
as a site, or situation, 
and with the article 
(le) before it (Les­
ter) a churchyarde, or 

 

Court about a house. 
But at this day there 
is noe suche regarde 
made in the particion, 
but onely consideration 
had, that the partes 
them selues be equal & 
indifferent. 
 
12  And then let the 
eldest brother haue the 
first choyse, and the 
others afterwarde ac­
cording to their degree 
13  Likewise of hou­
ses which shalbe found 
in such messuages, let 
them bee departed a­
mongst the heires by 
equall porcions, that 
is to weete, by foote 
if neede bee, Sauinge 
the Couert of the As­
ter which shal remain 
to the yongest sonne, 
or daughter, as is be­
foresayd. So neuer­
thelesse, that the yongest 
make reasonable a­
mends to his parceners 
for the part which to 
them belongeth, by the 
award of good men. 

 

14  And of the afore­
said tenements, where­
if one onely suit was 
wont to be made be­
fore time, be there not 
by reason of the parti­
cion but one sole suite 
made, as it was before 
accustomed, but yet let 
al the parceners make 
contributyon to the 
parcener which ma­
keth the suit for them. 
15  In lyke sort let 
the goods of Gauelkind 
persons be parted into 
iij parts, after the fu­
nerals and the debtes 
payed, if there be law­
ful issue on liue, so that
the dead haue one part, 
and his lawful sonnes 
and daughter an other 
part, and the wife the 
iij. part. 
 
Where it is sayde 
here, that the dead shal 
haue one part, it is ment 
for performance of his 
legacies by his execu­
tours if he make a tes­
tament, or by the dis­

 

cretion of the ordinary 
if he dye intest. 
16  And if there be no 
lawfull issue on lyue, 
let the dead haue the 
one halfe, & the wife a 
liue the other halfe. The 
selfe same order that the 
custome here speakest 
of in the xv. & xvi. diui­
sion, is at this day ob­
serued in the citye of 
London, and the same 
in effect was longe 
since vsed throughout 
the whole Realme. 
For it is euident both 
by the law of Kynge 
Canutus, by master 
Glanuil, by the words 
of Magna Charta cap
18. by master Fitzh. 
in his natura breuium in 
the writ de rationabili 
parte bonorum fol. 122.
L.  That the wife 
and children had their 
reasonable partes of 
the goodes by the com­
mon lawe of the realme 
and that the common law 
was so, it appeareth 

 

also in 30. E. 3. 25. 
& 21. 30. H. 6. And it 
was said for law M. 
31. H. 8. abridged by 
M. Br. titulo Rationabili 
parte bonorum, pl. 6. that it 
hath bene often put in 
vse as a common law, & 
neuer demurred vpon 
and therefore it see­
meth that it is com­
mon law, howsoeuer 
it came to passe at 
lenght that it was 
admitted for law, but 
in such countries one­
ly, where it was con­
tinued by daily vsage, 
and that al the writs 
in the register de rati­
onabili parte bonorum,
haue mencion of the 
special custome of the 
shire, in which the 
party is demaunded, 
and so in the book 28. 
H. 6. 4.  But as at 
this daye partition of 
Chattelles is not v­
sed through out the 
whole realme, though 
in the meane tyme it 

 

hath not lost the force 
of common law as ma­
ny thinke, and as may 
be gathered by the o­
pinion aforesaid hol­
den for law anno 31. 
H. 8. So is it as some 
thinke, vanished quite 
out of all vre within 
this countrie of Kent 
also. 
 
17  And if the heire 
or heires, shal be vn­
der the age of 15 yerez 
let the nurture of them
be committed by the 
lorde, to the next of the
bloud to whom the in­
heritance can not dis­
cend, so that the lord 
take nothinge for 
the committing there 
of. 
 
18  And let not the 
heire be married by the
Lord but by his owne 
will, and by the ad­
uise of his friendes if 
hee will. 
 
19  And when such 
heire, or heires, shall 
come to the age of 15. 

 

yeares, let their lands 
and tenementes be de­
lyuered vnto them to­
gether with their goodes 
and profits of the same 
landes, remainingge a­
boue their reasonable 
sustenaunce: of the 
which profites and 
goodes, lett hym bee 
bounde to make aun­
swere which had the 
educatyon of the heire 
or els the Lorde, or 
hys heires which com­
mitted the same edu­
cation. 
 
The lord ought to 
take good heede, that 
he credit not the cus­
todye to anye person 
that shall not bee able 
to aunswere there­
fore. For if the heire 
to his ful age of 15. 
yeares shall come to the
lords court, and de­
maund his enheritance 
although the Lorde 
may distreine the gar­
den to yeld his accompt 
(as it appeareth 18. 

 

E. 2. Auowry 220.) 
yet in default of his a­
bilitie, the Lorde him 
selfe, and his heires, 
remaine charged to the 
heire for the same: But 
I do not heare, that 
the Lordes take vpon 
them at this daye to 
commit the custody of 
these infants, but that 
they leaue it altoge­
ther to the order of the
next of kyn, peraduen­
ture to auoid the daun­
ger in which they are, 
if they intermedle as 
is aforesaid. 
 
20  And this is to bee 
vnderstood, that from such 
time as those heires in 
Gauelkinde be of, or 
haue passed the age of 
15. yeres, it is lawful 
for them, their landes 
or tenements, to giue 
and sell at their plea­
sure, Sauinge the 
seruices to the chiefe 
lordes, as is before­
sayd. 
 
Although that this 

 

custome enable the heire 
to make awaye hys 
lands and tenementes 
very soone, namely at 
the fiftenth yere of his 
age, by meanes wher­
of it might be thought 
vnreasonable in gy­
uing such scope and li­
berty to so yong yeres, 
yet vpon the good con­
sideration thereof it 
may appeare, that the 
custome it selfe doth 
reasonably and care­
fully prouide in the 
behalfe of the heire for 
so much as it licenceth 
him at that yeares not 
to geue his landes, for 
that hee might do for 
nothinge, but to geue 
and sell hys landes, 
which it meaneth hee 
should not do without 
sufficient recompence. 
Such like interpreta­
tion, the common law 
also seemeth to make 
of this custome both 
by the opinion of Va­
uisour & Keble. 5. H. 7. 

 

31. & 41. who said, that 
it was adiudged that 
a releas made by such 
an enfant was voyde. 
by the sentence of the 
booke 21. E. 4. 24. 
where it is sayd, that 
an infant cannot de­
clare his wil vpon such 
a feoffement. And by 
the iudgment of Hank 
11. H. 4. 33. who also 
held, that a warranty 
or graunt of a reuersi­
on made at such age, 
was to no purpose at 
all, although a lease with
releas might hapely be 
good by the custome, be­
cause that amounteth to a 
feffement. And it is not 
fit that this custome should 
bee construed by equi­
tye, for as much as it 
standeth not with any 
equitie, to enable an 
infant, of little dys­
cretion, and lesse ex­
perience, to sell hys 
land, & not to prouyde 
withal that he should 
haue Quid pro quo, and 

 

some reasonable re­
compence for the same: 
for that were not to 
defend the pupil & fa­
therlesse, but to laye 
him wide open to eue­
ry slie deceyt and cir­
cumuention. In which 
respect, their opinion is 
very wel to be liked of, 
who holde, that if an 
infant in Gauelkind, 
at this day will sel at 
x.v. yers of age, these 3. 
things ought of neces­
sitie to concurre, if he 
will haue the sale good 
& effectuall. The first 
that he be an heire, and 
not a purchaser of the 
land that he departeth 
withall. The seconde 
that he haue recompence 
for it: & the third, that 
he do it with liuery of 
seisin by his own hand, 
and not by warrant of 
attourney, nor by any 
other manner of assu­
rance. And these men 
for proofe of the first & 
seconde point of their 

 

assertion, do build vpon
the words of this custome 
where it is said from 
such time as those hei­
res in Gauelkind be of 
or haue passed the age of 
xv. yeres, it is lawful 
for them, their lands or 
tenements to giue and 
sel, in which the wordes 
(those heires) do res­
train the infant that com­
meth in by purchase. 
And (giue & let) in the 
copulatiue, do of neces­
sity imply a recompence, 
forsomuch as sellinge 
cannot be without some 
price or thing giuen for 
it. And for maintenance 
of the iij. matter they 
haue of their part be­
sides the common vsage 
of the countrey, the comon
law of the realme also, 
which expoundeth the 
word (giue) to meane a 
feffement, & which not 
onely disalloweth of 
any gift made by an 
infaunt, but also pu­
nysheth the taker in 

 

trespas, vnless he haue 
it by liuery from the 
infants owne hands as 
appeareth in 26. H. 8. 
2. 9. H. 7. 24. 18 E. 4. 
2. 22. H. 6. 3. & diuers 
other bookes. 
 
2I  And if any such 
tenant in Gauelkinde 
die, & haue a wife that 
ouer lyueth him, let 
that wife by & by bee 
endowed of the one 
halfe of the tenements 
whereof her husbande 
died vested, and seysed 
by the heires, if they 
bee of age, or by the 
Lords, if the heire bee 
not of age, so that shee 
may haue the one halfe 
of those lands, & tene­
ments, to hold so long 
as shee keepeth her a 
widow, or shalbe at­
tainted of child birth, 
after the auncient v­
sage, that is to saye, 
that if she when she is deli­
uered of child, & the infant 
be herde cry, & that the 
hue & crie, be raised, & 

 

the country assembled, 
and haue the viewe of 
the child so borne, and 
the mother: then let 
her loose her dower 
wholy, and otherwise 
not, so longe as shee 
holdeth her a widow, 
whereof it is sayde in 
kentish. 
 
He that doth wende her, 
Let him lende her.
 
This custome hath 
bene allowed of, by the 
common lawe longe 
time since, as may bee 
reade, Prærog. regis cap. 
16. & 2. H. 3. in Fitz. titulo
Prescription 59. &c. 
But it is a doubte 
whether a womanne 
shall bee endowed by 
this custome of a pos­
sessyon in lawe or no, 
for that the wordes, 
bee (of the tene­
mentes whereof her 
husbande dyed vested 
and seysed (whych 
word, vested, inforceth 

 

a possession in deede & 
not in law onely. And 
therefore, if landes in 
Gauelkind discend to 
a married man, which 
dyeth before he make 
his entrie into the same. 
Inquire whether it 
be the maner to endow 
his wife therof or no: 
A woman shal not bee 
endowed by this cus­
tome of a Bailywike, 
or Faire, or such like 
profite by the opinion 
of M. Perkins folio 84. 
because the wordes of 
this customarie dower 
be terres & tenementa, & 
al customes shall finde 
a litteral and streyght 
interpretacion. And 
where she is to be en­
dowed by this custome 
she may very well bee 
endowed of a moitie, 
to be holden in common 
with the heire that en­
ioyeth the other halfe 
&c. It is a doubt whe­
ther that a woman en­
tituled to Dower in 

 

Gauerkind may waiu 
her dower of the halfe 
after this custome, & 
bringe her accion to be 
endowed of the 3. at the
common law, and so 
exempt her selfe from 
al daunger of the custo­
mary conditions or no? 
Some haue bene of o­
pinion that she is at ly­
berty to take one and 
refuse the other at her 
pleasure: & therefore 
inquire thereof &c. 
 
22  And they claime 
also, that if a manne 
take a wife which 
hath inheritaunce of 
Gauelkind, and the 
wife diethe before him 
let the husband haue 
the one halfe of those 
lands & tenements wher 
of she dieth seised soe 
long as he holdeth him
a widower, without do­
ng any strippe, or wast 
or banishment, whether 
there wee issue be­
twene them or no. And 
if he take another wife 

 

lett hym loose all. 
 
23  And if any te­
nement of Gauelkind 
doe escheat (and that 
escheat be to any lorde 
which holdeth by fee 
of Hawberke, or by 
Serieancye) by death 
or by Gauelette as 
is hereafter sayd, or 
bee to him rendered 
vp by hys tenaunt 
which beefore helde 
it of him by quitte 
claime thereof made, 
or yf hys escheate bee 
by gauelate as is here 
after said, let thys 
lande remaine to the 
heires vnpartible: and 
this is to bee vnder­
stode, where the tenant 
so rendringe, doth re­
tain no seruice to him 
selfe, but saueth neuer 
the lese to the other lords 
their fees, fermes & the
rents wherewith the a­
foresaid tenements of 
gauelkind (so rendred) 
were before chargd by 
him or them which might 

 

charge them. 
 
To holde by fee of 
Hawbert, or by Ser­
iancie (if it be graunde 
Seriancie) is to hold 
by knightes seruyce. 
Heahbeony in Saxon, 
is a high defence: and 
the customes of Nor­
mandie called that fief
or fee de Haubert, 
which oweth to de­
fend the lande by full 
armes, that is, by 
horse, haubert, target, 
sworde, or helme. And 
it consisteth of 300. a­
cres of land, which is 
the same (as some think) 
that wee call a whole 
Knightes fee. 
 
24  And they clayme 
also, that if any tenant 
in Gauelkinde wyth­
hold his rent & his ser­
uices of the tenement 
which hee holdeth of 
his lord, let the Lorde 
seeke by the awarde of 
his Court from three 
weekes to iij. weekes, 
to finde some distres 

 

vpon that tenement, 
vntil the iiij. Court, 
alwayes wyth wit­
nesses. And if within 
that time, he can finde 
no distres in that te­
nement, whereby hee 
may haue iustice of his 
tenaunt. Then at the 
fowerth court let yt 
be awarded, that hee 
shal take that tenement 
into his hande, in the 
name of a distres, as if 
it were an oxe or a cow 
& let him kepe it a yere 
& a day in his hand with­
out manuring it: within 
which terme if the te­
naunt come & pay hys 
arrerages, & make rea­
sonable amendes for the
withholding, then let him 
haue & enioy his tene­
ment as his auncestors 
& he before held it: & if 
he do not come before 
the yeare and the day 
paste, then let the 
Lord goe to the next 
Countie court wyth 
the witnesses of hys 

 

owne Court, and pro­
nounce there this pro­
cesse, to haue further 
witnesse, and by the a­
warde of hys Court, 
(after the Countie 
court holden) he shall 
enter and manure in 
those lands & tenements 
as in his owne demes­
nes. And if the tenant 
come afterwarde, and 
will rehaue his tene­
ments, & hold them as 
he did before, let hym 
make agreement wyth 
the Lord, according as 
it is aunciently said. 
 
Hath he not since any 
thing gyuen? nor hath 
he not since any thing 
paied? Then let him 
pay fyue pounde for 
hys were, before hee 
beecome tenaunt or 
holder againe. 
 
Some copyes haue 
the first verse thus. 
 
Let him ix times pay 
and ix. times repay. 

 

This custome is tou­
ched by the way by 
Master Frowick 21. H. 7 
.15. and by him thought 
to be good, but whe­
ther it bee at this day 
put in vre, enquyre 
further. 
 
25  Also they claime 
that no man ought to 
make an othe vpon a 
booke, (neyther by dis­
tres, nor by the power 
of the Lorde, nor hys 
Bailife) against hys 
will, without the writ of 
the king (vnlesse it bee 
for fealtie to be don to 
his Lord,) but onely 
before the Coroner, or 
such other minister of 
the king, that hath royal 
power to enquire of 
trespas committed a­
gainst the Crowne of 
our Lord the king. 
 
26  And they claime 
that euery Kentishman
may essoine another, 
either in the Kinges 
court, or in the county, 
or in the hundreth, or in the

 

court of his lord wher 
essoine lieth, & that as­
wel in case of common
sute, as of plee. 
 
27  Moreouer they 
claime by an especiall 
deede of kinge Henry, 
the father of Kynge 
Edwarde, that of the 
tenementes which are 
holden in Gauelkinde 
there shall no battaile 
be ioined, nor graunde 
assise taken by xij. 
knightes, as it is v­
sed in other places of 
the Realme: that is 
to wit, where the te­
naunt and demaun­
daunt hold by Gauel­
kinde: But in place 
of these graund assi­
ses, let iuries be taken
by xij. men beinge te­
nants in Gauelkinde, 
so that fower tenants 
of Gauelkend chose 
xiij. tenants of Gauel­
kind to be iurors. 
 
And the charter of the
kinge of this especial­
ty, is in the custody of sir 

 

Iohn of Norwood, 
the day of S. Elphey 
in Caunterburye the 
yeare of kinge Edw. 
the sonne of kinge 
Henry the 21. 
 
These be the vsa­
ges of Gauelkind, & 
of Gauelkinde men in 
Kent, which were be­
fore the conquest, and 
at the conquest, and 
euer since til now 
The end of the customes 
 
Hauinge thus en­
ded the customes as 
you see (Brother Ni­
cholas) there remay­
neth now to be shew­
ed what lands within 
this country of Kent, 
bee of the nature 
of Gauelkinde, and 
what not. 
 
First therefore, it 
is to be vnderstanded, 
that al the lands with 
in this shire which be 
of auncient Socage 
tenure (as was said at 
the beginninge) bee 

 

also of the nature of 
Gauelkind. And the 
landes holden by aun­
 
cient tenure of knights 
seruice, be at the com­
mon law, & are not de­
partible after the or­
der of thys custome, 
except certeine whych 
beeing holden of olde 
time by knightes ser­
uice of the Archbishop 
of Caunterbury, are 
neuer the lesse depar­
tible, as it may ap­
peare by the booke 26. 
H. 8. 4. And that 
grew by reason of a 
graunt made by kinge 
Iohn, to Hubert the 
Archbishop there, the 
tenour of which is as 
followeth. 
 
¶ Iohn by the grace 
of God, king of Eng­
land, Lord of Ireland, 
Duke of Normandie, 
of Aquitane, and earle 
of Angieu: To all 
Archbishops, bishops, 
Abbots, Earles, Ba­
rons, Iustices, sherifs, 

 

Gouernours, & Offi­
cers, and all Bailifes, 
& al his faithfull sub­
iectes greeting. Know 
yee that wee haue gran­
ted, & by this our pre­
sent Charter haue con­
firmed, to our reuerend 
& deerely beloued fa­
ther Hubert Archby­
shop of Caunterbury, 
and his successors for 
euer, that it shalbe law­
ful for them, to con­
uert those lands which 
men of the fee of the 
Church of Canterbu­
rie do hold in Gauel­
kind into knights fee. 
And that the same bi­
shops and their suc­
cessors, haue the lyke 
power and libertie for 
euer, ouer those men & 
their heires, that shal 
holde those landes so 
conuerted into knights 
fee, which the Archbi­
shop hath & his succes­
sors after him shal haue, 
ouer other knights of 
the fee of the Church 

 

of Canterbury & their 
heirs. And that those men 
& their heires haue the 
same & al such libertie 
foreuer, which other 
knights of the fee of the 
church of Canterb. & 
their heirs haue. Pro­
uided alwaies that neuer­
thelesse their accusto­
med rent of pence, bee 
wholly payed out of 
their landes, as before 
time their giftes, aue­
rages, and other serui­
ces which issued out of 
the same lands be con­
uerted into a rent of 
pence of like value, & 
the same rent be paied 
as the other rent of pence 
is. Wherefore we will 
& straightly commaund, 
that whatsoeuer the afore­
named Archbishop & 
his successors after him
shal do concerning those 
lands which are to bee 
conuerted into knights 
fee, according to the forme 
& maner aboue written, 
abide ratified & confir­

 

med for euer. Forbid­
ding any person to pre­
sume against the deede 
of the Archbishop or 
his successors in thys 
behalfe. Witnesse E.

yeuen by the hande of 
S. Archdeacon vnto 
William at Rupein au­
riuall; the iiij. day of 
May, the third yeare 
of our Raigne. 
 
But for asmuch as it 
is disputable, whether 
this Charter of King 
Iohn, be of sufficient 
vertue to chaunge the 
nature of Gauelkinde 
lande, or no, & for that 
the certeintie of the 
lands so conuerted in­
to knightes fee, doth 

 

not any where appere, 
(saue onely that in 
the booke of Ayde le­
uied in this shire. An­
no 20. E. 3. it is iiij. 
or fiue times noted, 
that certeine lands in 
Kent bee holden in 
knightes seruice, by 
the new lycence graun­
ted to the archbishop) 
this shall suffice for that. 
& it shal follow to bee 
proued, that al the lands 
of auncient tenure in 
knightes seruice, bee 
subiect to the ordinary 
course of discent at the 
common law. And that 
may sufficiently bee 
done both by the expresse 
wordes of a note in 9. 
H. 3. abridged by M. 
Brook titulo Customes 57 
& in M. Fitzh. ti. Pre­
scription 63. & by the 
opinion of the Iustices 
26. H. 8. 4. as also by 
plein recital in the act 
of Parlaiment made 
31. H. 8. ca. 3. by which 
statute, the possessions 

 

of certeyne Gentle­
men there were dely­
uered from this custo­
marie discent, and in­
corporated to the com­
mon lawe, for (a­
mongest other things) 
in that acte it is said: 
that from thence forth 
such their landes shal­
be chaunged from the 
sayde custome, and 
shall dyscende, as 
landes at the common 
lawe, and as other 
landes beeing in the 
said County of Kent, 
which neuer were hol­
den by seruice of so­
cage, alwayes but 
haue been holden by 
knightes seruice, doe 
discende. By which 
woordes, it is verye 
euident, that the ma­
kers of that estatute 
vnderstood al lands hol­
den by knights seruice 
to bee of their proper 
nature, discendable af­
ter the common law, & 
that socag. tenure was 

 

the onely subiect, in 
which thys our cus­
tome of Gauelkinde 
discent, preuayled and 
helde place. 
 
But when mencion 
is here made of So­
cage & knightes fee, it 
must alwayes be vn­
derstanden a Tenure 
long since, & of auncient 
time continued, & not 
now newely or lately 
created, for so it may 
fal out otherwise then 
is alreadie reported. 
As for example, If 
lande aunciently hol­
den by knightes ser­
uyce, come to the 
Queenes hands, who 
afterward gyueth the 
same out againe to a 
common person, to bee 
holden of, her manour 
of East Grenewich in 
socage) this land not­
withstanding the alte­
ration of the tenure) 
remaineth discendable 
to the eldest sonne only, 
as it was befor, as also 

 

in like sort, if lands of 
auncient Socage ser­
uice come to the Crowne, 
and bee deliuered out 
agayne, to bee holden
eyther of the Queene 
in Capyte, or by 
 
knightes seruice of a­
ny manor, it ought to 
discend accordinge to 
the custome notwith­
standing that the te­
nure bee altered, and 
if this bee true in the 
graunt of the Queene 
her selfe: then much 
lesse may the Archbi­
shop by newe creati­
on of tenure, make to 
his tenants any alte­
ration of this old cus­
tome & maner, For as 
the pleading is, That 
the lands aforesaid, are 
of the tenure & nature 
of Gauelkind, euen so 
the truith is, that the pre­
sent tenure onely gui­
deth not the discent, 
but that the tenure & 
the nature together, 
doe gouerne it. And 

 

therfore, as on the one 
side, the custome can­
not attache, or take 
holde of that whiche 
was not before in na­
ture subiect to the cus­
tome, that is to say, 
accustomably departed 
So on the other side, 
the practise of the cus­
tome, long time conti­
nued, may not be in­
terrupted by a bare al­
teration of the tenure, 
as it was holden by 
the Iustices, Anno 4. 
& 5. Phi, & Mary, as 
Iustice Dalison hath 
left reported. And al­
so as it appereth by the 
book 26. H. 8. 4. where 
it is said, that if a man 
seised of Gauelkinde 
land holden in Socage, 
make a gyft in tayle 
and create a tenure 
in knightes seruyce, 
that yet thys lande 
muste descende after 
the custome it did be­
fore the change of the 
tenure. 

 

Moreouer, as the 
chaunge of the tenure 
cannot preuaile against 
this custome: So nei­
ther the continuaunce 
of a contrarye vsage, 
may alter thys pre­
scription. For it is 
holden 16. E. 3. in Fitz. 
titulo Prescription 52. 
that albeit the eldest 
soune onely hath (and 
that for many discents 
together) entred into 
Gauelkinde land, and 
occupyeth it without 
any contradiction of the
yonger brothers, that 
yet the lande remay­
neth partible betwene 
them, whensoeuer they 
will put to their claime 
Agaynst which asser­
tion, that which is 
said 10. H. 3. in Fitzh. 
titulo Prescripcion 64 
namely of the issue 
taken thus. Whether 
the lande were par­
ted or no is not great­
ly forceable. For al­
though it bee so, that the

 

lande were neuer par­
ted in deede, yet if it re­
maine partible in na­
ture, it may bee par­
ted whensoeuer occa­
sion shalbee ministred. 
And therefore, euen 
in the fourme of plea­
dinge vsed at this day 
(That the lande al­
waies &c. was par­
tible, and parted) it 
is playnlie taken, that 
the worde (partible) 
onely is of substaunce, 
& that the word (par­
ted) is but a worde of 
fourme, & not materi­
al, or trauersable at al, 
yea so inseperable is 
this custome from the 
land in which it obtai­
neth, that a contrary dis­
cent (continued in the 
case of the Crowne it 
selfe) cannot hinder, 
but that (after such 
time as the land shall 
resorte agayne to a 
common person) the 
fourmer olde custome 
shall gouerne it. As 

 

if lands of Gauelkind 
nature come to the 
Queenes handes by 
purchase, or by Es­
chete as holden of her 
manor of Dale, nowe 
after her death, all her 
sonnes shall inherite 
and deuide them. But 
if they come to her by 
forfaiture in treason, 
or by gift in parlya­
ment, so that her grace 
is seised of them in right 
of the crowne, then 
her eldest sonne onely 
(which shalbe kinge 
after her) shal enioy 
them, in which case al­
though those landes 
which the eldest sonne 
beinge kinge) did pos­
sesse, do come to his 
eldest sonne after him 
(being king also) and 
so from one to an o­
ther, by sundry dis­
centes, yet the opi­
nion of Sir Anthony 
Browne was 7. Eliza­
beth, that if at any 
tyme after the same 

 

landes be graunted to 
a common person, they 
shall reuolt to their 
former nature of Ga­
uelkind and be parti­
ble amongst his heires 
males, notwythstan­
dinge that they haue 
runne a contrary course 
in dyuers the dys­
cents of the kings be­
fore. But much lesse 
may the vnity of pos­
session in the Lorde 
frustrate the custome 
of Gauelkynde dys­
cent as may appeare, 
14. Hen. 4. in the 
longe Recordare, a­
bridged by Master 
Brooke titulo Auowry 
46. and titulo Customes
19. 
 
Now followeth to 
bee spoken howe farre 
thys custome exten­
deth it selfe wythin 
this our Countrey of 
Kent &c. 
 
It is commonlye 
taken that the cus­
tome of Gauelkinde 

 

is general, & spreadeth 
it selfe throughout the 
whole Shire into all 
lands subiect by aun­
cient tenure vnto the 
same, such places only 
excepted, where it is 
altered by act of par­
lyament. And there­
fore in 5. E. 4. 18. and 
14. H. 4. 8. it is sayd, 
that the Custome of 
Gauelkinde is (as it 
were a common lawe 
in Kent. And the 
booke 22. E. 4. 19. 
affirmeth, that in de­
maunding Gauelkind 
lande, a man shall not 
neede to prescribe in 
certeyne, and to shew 
that the Towne, Bo­
roughe, or Citye, 
where the landes be, 
is an auncient towne, 
Boroughe, or Cy­

 

tie, and that the cus­
tome hath byn there 
(time out of mynde) 
that the landes with­
in the same Towne, 
Borough, or Citie, 
should discende to all 
the heires males &c. 
But that is sufficient­
ly inough to shew the 
Custome at large, and 
to say, that the lande 
lieth in Kent, and that 
all the lands there bee 
of the nature of Ga­
uelkind. For a writ of 
particion of landes in 
Gauelkind) saith M. 
Littleton) shall bee as 
generall, as if the 
lands were at the co­
mon lawe, although 
the declaration ought 
specyally to containe 
mencion of the Cus­
tome of the Coun­
trey. This vniuer­
salytie considered, and 
also the strayte bonde 
(whereby the cus­
tome is so inseperablye
knit to the lande, as 
in manner nothynge 
but an acte of Parli­
ment can clerely dis­
seuer them) it follo­
eth, that no place 
Citye, Towne, or 

 

Borough within this 
shire, can bee exempt 
from this custome al­
though the same hath 
not at any time byn 
there put in vre, no 
more then the Eldest 
sonne (in the case 
beefore) maye for 
the lyke reason pre­
scrybe agaynst hys 
younger Bretheren &c. 
 
Thus much beinge 
spoken touchinge the 
name, tenure, nature, 
generalty, and order 
of Gauelkind: it shall 
nowe bee shewed of 
what qualitie the rents, 
remainders, actions, 
and such other things 
(of the which some be 
issuinge out of these 
landes, some bee an­
nexed vnto them, and 
some bee raised by rea­
son of them) shalbee. 
And of them some shall 
ensue the nature of the 
land & other some shal 
keepe the same course 
that common law hath 

 

appointed. And there­
fore if a rent be graun­
ted in fee out of Ga­
uelkinde lande, it shal 
dyscende to all the 
males as the lande it 
selfe shal do, as appea­
reth in 14. H. 8. 5. 26. 
H. 8. 4. & 4. E. 3. 
 
But if ij. iointenants 
of land in Gauelkinde 
grant a rent charge out 
of that land to I. S. 
& to his heires, and I. 
S. dieth hauing issue 
ij. sonnes, this rent shal 
not discend to both the 
sonnes of I. S. but to 
the heire at the com­
mon law because that 
the custome is in sus­
pence during the ioin­
ture by the opinion of 
the ryght worship­
full Christopher Yel­
uerton Esquire, at 
his reading in Graies 
Inne in lent Anno. 
1573. 
 
So if a tenauncye 
bee of Gauelkynde 

 

nature, yet the rent 
seruice by which it is 
holden may discende 
according to the com­
mon lawe, as Ald' and 
Chart' in 7. E. 3. were 
of opinion. 
 
If a remaynder of 
Gauelkinde lande bee 
tayled to the heires 
males, they altoge­
ther shall inherite as 
Fitzherbert & Norwich. 
thought 26. H. 8. 4. 
But that is to be vn­
derstoode of a dyscent 
onely, for if landes of 
Gauelkinde nature be 
leased for lyfe, the re­
mainder to the ryght 
heires of Iohn Stile 
which hath issue fo­
wer sonnes and dy­
eth, and after the les­
see for lyfe dyeth, 
nowe the eldest sonne 
onely of Iohn Stile 
shall haue this lande, 
for hee is right heire, 
& that is a good name 
of purchase 37. H. 8. 
is Master Brooke titulo

 

Done & Remaynder 
42. But if the landes 
had bin giuen to Iohn 
Stile for life, the re­
mainder to hys next 
heire male, this had 
bin as estate tayle in 
Iohn Stile him selfe, 
and then the lande 
shoulde haue discen­
ded to al his sonnes, 
in so much as in that 
case the wordes (next 
heire male) bee not a 
name of purchase. 
Howebeit yt was 
greatly doubted 3. & 
4. Ph. & Ma. (as Ius­
tice Dalison reporteth) 
if a remainder be de­
uised by testament (to 
the next heire male) 
whether in that case 
the eldest brother one­
ly shall haue it, in 
so much as (in the 
vnderstanding of the 
lawe, which is a iudge 
ouer al customes) he 
is the next heire male 
and therefore inquire 
of it. 

 

As touchinge vou­
chers, it appeareth 11. 
E. 4. that al the heirs 
in gauelkind shal bee 
vouched for the war­
ranty of their aunces­
tor, and not the eldest 
onely. But the opiny­
on of master Littleton
li. 3. cap. 13. and of the
Iustices 22. E. 4. is 
clere that the eldest 
sonne onely shall bee 
rebutted, or barred by 
the warranty of the 
auncestor: to be short, 
the eldest sonne onely 
shal enter for the breach 
of a condition, but the
rest of the brethren 
shall be ioined with 
him in suinge a writt 
of attaint to reforme 
a false verdict, or Er­
rour, to reuerse an er­
ronious iudgement, 
And they all shall bee 
charged for the debt of 
their auncestor, if so be 
that they all haue assets 
in their hands. But if 
the eldest onely haue 

 

assets remaining, and 
the residue haue alie­
ned their parts, then 
he onely shal be char­
ged after the minde 
of the booke 11. E. 
3. &c. And thus 
muche for this parte 
shall suffice. 
 
Now a worde or 
two of other thinges 
confusedly, yet apper­
taininge to this mat­
ter, notwithstandinge 
not so necessarie for 
your purpose to bee 
knowen as those a­
foresaid. It appeareth 
in a written report at 
large or 16. Edwarde 
2. which is also part­
lye abridged by mas­
ter Fitzherbert titulo
Prescription, that it 
was tried by verdicte 
that no man ought to 
haue common in lands 
of Gauelkinde, how 
beit the contrarye is 
well knowen at this 
day, and that in ma­
nye places the same 

 

booke saieth, that the v­
sage of gauelkinde is, 
that a man may law­
fully inchase, or driue 
out into the high way 
to their aduenture, the
beasts of anye other 
person that he shal find 
doinge dammage in 
his land, and that hee 
is not compellable to 
impound them, which 
thinge is practised at 
this day. 
 
The parliament 15. 
Henrici sexti cap. 3. 
mindinge to amplifie 
the priuiledges of ga­
uelkind, graunted to 
the tenants of that 
land, exemption in at­
taints, in such sort as 
the inhabitaunts of 
auncyent demeane, & 
of the fiue ports, bee­
fore had: But with 
in three yeares after 
vppon complaint of 
some of the Countrye 
which enformed the 
parliament house that 
there was not in the 

 

whole Shire thirtye 
or forty persons, that 
hold to the value of xx. 
pounde lande, out of 
Gauelkinde, who is 
default of others, and 
by reason of that ex­
emption, were conti­
nually molested by re­
turnes in Attaintes, 
that act was vtterlye 
repealed. 
 
The statute 14. H. 
8. cap. 6. giueth liber­
tie to euery man) ha­
uinge highwaye in the 
welde that is worne 
deepe, and incommo­
dious for passage) to 
lay out an other way 
in some suche other 
place of hys lande, as 
shal be thought made 
by the viewe of two 
Iustices of the peace, 
and twelue other men 
of wisdome and discre­
tion. 
 
The generall lawe, 
made 35. H. 8. 17. for 
the preseruatyon of 

 

Copises woods tho­
rough out the realme, 
maketh plain excepti­
on of al woods within 
this weald, vnlesse it 
be of such as be common 
And here an ende of 
this matter; sauing that
I will make master 
Littletons aunswere 
to such as happely wil 
demaund what reason 
this custome of gauel­
kind discent hath, thus 
to deuide land among 
al the males contrary 
to the manner of the 
whole Realme besids: 
The yonger sonnes 
(saieth hee) be as good 
gentlemen as the el­
der, and they (beinge 
a like deere to theyr 
common auncestour, 
from whom they claim) 
haue so much the more 
neede of their frendes 
helpe as thorough 
their minoritye) they 
be lesse able then the 
elder brother to helpe 
them selues.

 

¶ Gelde.
GElde, that is to be 
quite of seruile cus­
tomes whiche were 
wont to bee geeuen, 
and are yet geeuen, 
as hornegeld and such 
lyke.
 
¶ Grithbrech.
GRithbrech, that ys 
the kings peace bro­
ken, because (Grith) in 
english is pax in latin.
 
¶ Hangewite.
HAngwit, that is to 
be quite of a theefe 
or felone hanged without 
iudgement, or escaped 
out of your custody.
 
¶ Hariot.
HAriot is in two 
sortes, the one ha­
riot custome, the other 
hariot seruice. 

 

Hariot seruice (some 
say) is alwaies expres­
sed in a mans graunt, 
or dede that he holdeth 
by such seruice to pay 
hariot at the time of 
his death, and this ha­
riot is payable after 
the death of the tenant 
in fee simple. 
 
Hariot custome, ys 
where Hariotes haue 
bene payed tyme out 
of mynde by custome. 
And this may be af­
ter the death of te­
naunt for life &c. but 
to speake thereof ge­
nerally. 
 
Hariot is the best 
beast (whether it bee 
Horse, Oxe, or Cow) 
that the tenaunt had 
at the tyme of hys 
death. And may bee 
eyther seysed, or a 
distresse taken for it, 
whether it bee hariot 
seruice, or hariot cus­
tome, to the Lords vse 
of whom the tenaunt 
held, by his Bailife, or 

 

other officer belonginge 
to his manor. 
 
But of right the lord, 
nor his officer shoulde 
not take hariot before 
it be presented at the 
next court holden, that 
the tenant is dead, and 
that such a beast is due 
to the Lorde for hys 
hariot.
 
¶ Haybote or hedgebote
HAybote or hedgbot 
is necessarie, stuffe 
to make & mend hed­
ges, which lessee for 
yeres, or for life of com­
mon right may take 
vpon the ground to him 
leased, although it bee 
not expressed in his 
lease, & although it be 
a leas by words with 
out writinge. 
 
Hayebote also may 
bee taken for neces­
sarye stuffe, to make 
Rakes, forkes, and 
suche like Instru­
mentes where with 

 

men vse in sommer to 
tedde and make haye: 
& so a lessee for yeres 
tooke, and it was al­
lowed hym by his lei­
sor, the rather as I 
suppose, for that such 
instruments are com­
monly made of slender 
vnder wood, which by 
the common lawe the 
lessee for yeares maye 
cutte and take as is 
aforesaid.
 
¶ Hidage.
HIdage, that is to 
bee quit, if the king 
shal taxe al the lande 
by hides. 
 
Note that a hide of 
land is a whole plow­
lande. And this kind 
of taxinge by hides 
was much vsed in 
olde tyme, as wel for 
prouision of armoure, 
as payementes of mo­
ney, and that chefe­
ly in king Etheldreds 
daies (a kinge in this 

 

Countrey before the 
conquest) who in the 
yeare of Christ 1006. 
when as the Danes 
landed at Sandwich 
in Kent, taxed al hys 
land by hides thus. 
That euery 310 hides 
of lande should finde 
one ship fornished, and 
euery 8. hides shoulde 
finde one Iacke & one 
sallet, for the defence 
of the realme.
 
¶ Hotchpot.
HOtchpot, is a med­
linge, or mixinge 
together, and a parti­
cion of lands giuen in 
frankmariage, with 
other lands in fee sim­
ple discended, as for 
example, a man seised 
of 30. acres of lande in 
fee simple hath issu ij. 
daughters, and giueth 
with on of his daughters 
to a man that marieth 
her x. acres of the same 
land in frankemarry­

 

age, and dieth seised of 
the other 20. acres: 
Now if she that is 
thus maried wil haue 
any part of the xx. a­
cres whereof her fa­
ther died seised: Shee 
must put her landes 
geuen in frankemar­
riage in hotchpot, that 
is to say, she must re­
fuse that gift in frank­
marriage, and suffer 
the land to be commixt 
and mingled together 
with the other lande 
whereof her father di­
ed seised, so that an e­
qual diuision may bee 
made of the whole be­
twene her and her sis­
ter: and thus for her 
x. acres she shal haue 
xv. els her Sister wil 
haue the xx. acres, of 
which their father di­
ed seised.
 
¶ Homesoken.
HOme soken (or hame 
soken) that is to bee 

 

to be quite of amercia­
ments for entring into 
houses violently and 
without licence, and 
contrarie to the peace 
of the king. And that 
you holde plea of such 
trespasse done in your 
Court, and in your 
lande.
 
¶ Homicide or Man­
slaughter.
HOmicide or Man­
slaughter, is the kil­
ling of a man felonious­
ly without malice for­
thought. It is also de­
fined thus. Homicide is 
the killing of a man by a 
man, & if such killing 
be done by a dogge, oxe 
or other thinge, it is 
not properly called ho­
micide: for it is called 
homicide of a man & to 
kil as the killing of a man.
 
¶ Hornegelde.
HOrnegeld, that is 
to be quite of a cer­

 

teine custome exacted 
by tailage thorow all 
the lande, as of what 
soeuer horne beast.
 
¶ Housebote.
HOusebote is neces­
sarie tymber, that 
the lessee for yeres, or 
for lyfe, of common 
right may take vppon 
the ground, to repaire 
the houses vppon the 
same ground to hym 
leased, although it bee 
not expressed in the leas. 
& although it be a leas, 
by words without deede. 
But if hee take more 
then is needefull, hee 
may be punished by an 
action of wast.
 
¶ Hundred.
HVndredes weare 
deuided by Alfred 
the king, after that he 
had deuided the whole 
Realme into certeine 
partes or Sections, 

 

which of the Saxon 
woord Scynan signify­
ing to cut, he termed 
Shires, or (as we yet 
speake,) Shares and 
portions. These shi­
res he also brake into 
smaller partes, where 
of some were called 
Lathes of the woorde 
Ielapian, which is to 
assemble together: o­
thers Tithings so na­
med, because there 
were in ech of them to 
the number of x. per­
sons, whereof eche one 
was suertie & pledge 
for others good abea­
ring: others hundreds 
because they conteined 
iurisdyction ouer an 
hundred men or pled­
ges, dwelling perad­
uenture in ij. or iij. or 
more Parishes, Bo­
roughes, or townes, 
lying & adioyning ne­
uerthelesse somewhat 
nere together, in which 
he appointed adminis­
tration of iustice to be 

 

exercysed seuerally a­
monge them of the same 
hundred, and not that 
one should runne out 
disorderly into an o­
thers hundred, lath, or 
tithing, where in hee 
dwelleth not. These 
hundredes continue to 
this day in force, al­
though not altogether 
to the same purpose, 
whereunto at the first 
they were appointed, 
yet still verie needeful 
both in time of peace 
for good order of go­
uernment diuers waies 
& also in warre for cer­
teintie of leuying of 
men: as els for the more 
readie collectyons of 
paymentes graunted 
in Parliament to the 
kinges & Queenes of 
this Realme.
 
¶ Hundredum.
HVndredum, that is 
to be quyte of mo­
ney or customes to bee 

 

done to the Gouer­
nors & hundredors.
 
¶ Ideot.
IDeot is he that is a 
foole naturally from 
his byrth, and know­
eth not how to accompt 
or number xx. pence, 
nor cannot name hys 
father or mother, nor 
of what age himselfe 
is, or such like easie & 
common matters: so 
that it appeareth hee 
hath no maner of vn­
derstanding of reason, 
nor gouernement of 
him selfe, what is for 
his profit or disprofite 
&c. But if he haue so 
much knowledge that 
he can read, or learn to 
read by instruction & 
information of others 
or can measure an Ell 
of cloth, or name the 
dayes in the weeke, 
or begette a chylde, 
sonne or daughter, or 
suche lyke, whereby 

 

it may appeare that 
hee hath some lyght of 
reason: then such a 
one is no Ideot na­
turally.
 
¶ Vnlawfull assemblie.
VNlawful assemblie, 
is where people as­
semble them selues to­
gether to do some vn­
lawfull thing against 
the peace, although 
that they execute not 
their purpose in deede.
 
¶ Imparlance.
IMparlance is when 
an action of det, tres­
passe, or such lyke ys 
brought against a man 
& after that the playn­
tif hath counted or de­
clared, the defendant 
prayeth the Court, 
that he may haue time 
to put in his aunswere, 
at another day in the 
same terme, or in the 
next terme following, 

 

this stay of aunswere 
is called imparlance.
 
¶ Imprisonment.
IMprisonment is no 
other thing, but the 
restraint of a mans li­
bertie, whether it bee 
in the open fielde or in 
the Stockes, or cage, 
in the streats, or in a­
mans owne house as 
well as in the common 
gaole. And in all these 
places the partie so res­
trayned is said to bee 
a prysoner, so longe 
as he hath not his li­
bertie freely to go at 
all times whether hee 
will, without bayle, 
maynprise, or other 
aucthoritie.
 
¶ Infangethefe.
INfangethefe, that 
is that theues taken 
within your demesne 
or fee conuycted of 
theftes, shalbe iudged 

 

in your Court.
 
¶ Information.
INformation, for the 
Queene is that, 
which for a common 
person is called a de­
claration, and is not 
alwayes done directly 
by the Queene, or her 
Atturney, but rather 
by some other manne, 
who sueth or infour­
meth as well for the 
Queene, as for hym­
selfe vpon the breache 
of some penall law or 
statute, wherein a pe­
naltie is geeuen to the 
partie that wil sue for 
the same, but no acti­
on of debt to recouer 
it, then it must be had 
by information.
 
¶ Iointure.
IOinture is an estate 
and assurance made 
to a woman in consy­

 

deration of marryage 
for terme of her life, or 
otherwise, whether it 
be before or after the 
mariage. And if it bee 
after the maryage, then
she may at her libertie 
after the death of her 
husband refuse to take 
or haue the landes so 
assured for her ioyn­
ture, & demaunde her 
dower at the common 
law. But if it be made 
before mariage, then 
she may not refuse such 
iointure, nor haue do­
wer according to the 
common ley, vnlesse that
when she bringeth her 
writ of dower, the de­
fendant pleadeth such 
a plee that wil not barre 
her of her dower: then 
she shalbee endowed. 
As if he say in barre, 
that her husband was 
not sesed of such estate 
whereof she might bee 
endowed, or any such 
plee, & doth not shew that
she hath a iointure made 

 

&c. and therefore de­
maunde iudgement of 
that action, or iudge­
ment if she shalbe also 
endowed, or any such 
like plea &c. and this 
was the opinion of the 
right worshipful ma­
ster Brograue at hys 
readinge in Grayes 
Inne in Sommer An­
no 1576. 18. Elizab. 
vppon a braunch of 
the statute made An­
no 27. H. 8. ca. 10. con­
cerning iointures and 
dowers. 
 
And by him of those 
things whereof a wo­
man may be endowed, 
shee may haue ioyn­
ture as of mynes, ves­
turam terre, woodes, 
Townes, Iles, mea­
dowes, and such like. 
Also if an aduowson, 
of a reuersion depen­
dinge vppon an estate 
for lyfe, of a windmil, 
a high chamber, a rec­
torie and such other, 
and they are called te­

 

nementes. Also of a 
villen, for he is an he­
reditament. And of al 
these profit may come 
to the woman. But of 
those things whereof 
no profit will come, 
but rather a charge, 
a ioynture cannot be 
made.
 
¶ Theft.
THeft is a deceipt­
ful taking away of 
an other mans goods, 
but not from his per­
son, wyth a minde to 
steale them, agaynst 
his will whose goods 
they were. 
 
And theft is in 
two sortes, the one 
so called simple, and 
the other pety or lit­
tle theft. 
 
The first is where 
the thynge stollen ex­
ceedeth the value of 
xij. d. and that is fe­
lonye. 
 
The other¶  (which is 

 

called little or petite 
theft) is where the 
thing stollen doth not 
exceed the value of xij. 
d. & that is no felony.
 
¶ Lastage.
LAstage, that is to 
bee quite of a cer­
teyne custome exac­
ted in faires and mar­
kets for caryinge of 
thinges where a man 
will.
 
¶ Lessor and lessee.
LEssor is hee that 
lesseth lands or te­
nementes to an other 
for terme of life, yeres 
or at will, and hee to 
whome the lease is 
made, is called les­
see.
 
¶ Leuant & couchant.
LEuant, and Couc­
hant is sayd, when 
the beastes of Cattell 

 

of a straunger are 
come into an other 
mans grounde, and 
there haue remayned 
a certeyne good space 
of tyme, so long that 
they haue well fedde, 
and also rested them 
selues.
 
¶ *Wager of lawe.
Wager of lawe, is 
when an action is 
brought agaynst one 
without especialtye she­
wed, or other matter 
of recorde, as an action 
of debt vpon contract, 
or detinue, then the 
defendaunt may wage 
his lawe, that is to 
say, sweare vppon a 
booke, and certaine per­
sons with him, that kn 
oweth nothing to the 
plaintife in manner & 
fourme as hee hath de­
clared. But in an acti­
on of debt vpon a leas 
for terme of yeares, 
or vpon the arrerages 

 

of accompt before au­
ditors assigned, a man 
shal not wage his law 
And when one shall 
bring with him vj. viij 
or xij. or his neighbors 
as the court shall as­
signe him to sweare with
him. And if at that day 
assigned he faile of his 
lawe, then he shalbee 
condempned.
 
¶ Liuery of seisin.
LIuery of seisin, is 
a ceremony vsed in 
conueyance of landes 
or tenementes where 
an estate in fee simple, 
fee taile, or a freeholde 
shal passe: and it is a 
testimonial of the wil­
ling departinge from 
al that which he who 
makes the liuery hath 
in the thinge whereof 
liuerie is made: And 
the receyuinge of the 
liuery, is a willing ac­
ceptance by the other 

 

party, of al that wher 
of the other hath dis­
missed him selfe: And 
was inuented as an 
open and notorious 
thinge, by meanes 
whereof the common 
people might haue 
knowledge of the pas­
singe or alteration of 
estates from man to 
man, that thereby they 
might be the better 
able to trie in whom 
the right and possessi­
on of lands and tene­
ments were, if they 
should be impanneled 
in Iuries, or other­
wise haue to doe con­
cerning the same. 
 
The common maner 
of deliuery of seisin is 
after this sort done: 
If it be in the open 
feeld where is no buil­
dinge or house, then 
one that can reade ta­
keth the writinge in 
his hand, if the estate shal 
passe by deed, & decla­
reth to the standers by 

 

the cause of their mee­
tinge there together 
&c. and then openlye 
readeth the deede in 
English, and after that
it is sealed, the partye 
who is to depart from
the ground, taketh the
deed in his handes to­
gether with a clodde 
of the earthe, and a 
twigge or bowe if a­
ny be there, and all 
this he deliuereth to 
the other party in the 
name of possession or 
seisin, accordinge to the
forme and effect of the 
deed, which before them
was there reade. But 
if there be a dwelling 
house or building vp­
on the land, then this 
is done there at the 
doore of the same, none 
beeinge lefte at that 
tyme with in the 
House, and the par­
tye deliuereth all the 
aforesaide toogether 
with the ringe of the 
doore in the name 

 

of seisine or possession, 
and he that receiueth 
the liuerie entreth in 
first alone and shut­
teth too the doore, and 
presently openeth it 
againe, and lettethe 
them in &c. If it be of 
a house whereto is no 
land or ground, the li­
uerie is made and pos­
session taken by the 
deliuerie of the ringe 
of the doore and deed one­
ly. And where it is 
without deed either of 
lands, or tenementes, 
there the party decla­
reth by word of mouth 
before wittnesse, the 
estate that he meaneth 
to depart with, and 
then deliuereth seisine 
or possession in maner 
as is before said: & so 
the land or tenement 
doth passe as wel wher 
there is no deede as by 
deed, and that by force 
of the lyuerye of sei­
sine: It was agreed 
in Grayes Inne by 

 

the right worshipfull 
master Snagge, at his 
readinge there in som­
mer an. 2574. that if 
a feoffour deliuer the 
deede in view of the 
land, in name of seisin 
that it is good, because 
that he hath a possessi­
on in him selfe. But 
otherwise it is of an 
atturney, for he must 
goe to the land, and 
take possession him self 
before that hee can geue 
possession to an other, 
accordinge to the words 
of his letter &c., And 
where lyuerye of sei­
sin is by viewe, if the 
feoffee doe not enter 
after &c. nothinge 
passeth, for he ought 
to enter indeede.
 
¶ Lotherwite.
LOtherwite, that 
is that you maye 
take amendes of him 
which doth defile your 

 

bondwoman without 
your licence.
 
¶ Mahim, or Maime.
MAhim, is where a­
ny member is hurt 
or taken away, where­
by the partye so hurt 
is made vnperfecte to 
fight: As if a bone 
bee taken out of the 
hedde: or a bone bee 
broken in any other 
part of the bodye: or 
a foote, or hande, or 
finger, or ioynte of a 
foote, or any member be 
cut: or by some wound 
the sinewes be made 
to shrinke, or other 
member, or the fin­
gers made crooked, or 
if an eye be put out, or 
the foreteeth broken, 
or any other thinge 
hurt in a mans bodye 
by meanes whereof 
hee is made the lesse 
able to defende hym 
selfe. 
 
But the cutting off 

 

of an eare, or nose, or 
breaking of the hinder 
teeth, or such like, is 
no maihim, because it 
is rather a deformity 
of the body, then dimi­
nishinge of strength. 
And if the Iustices 
stande in doubt whe­
ther the hurt be a mai­
him or not, they vse, & 
wil of their great dis­
cretion take the helpe 
and opinion of some 
skilfull Surgeon, to 
consider thereof, before 
they determine vppon 
the case.
 
¶ Mainprise.
MAinprise is when
a man is arres­
ted by capias, 
then the Iudges may 
delyuer his bodye to 
certeyne menne for to 
keepe and to bringe 
him beefore them, at a 
certaine day, and these 
bee called maynper­
nours, and if the par­

 

tye appeare not at the 
day assigned, the main­
pernors shal be amer­
ced.
 
¶ Mannour.
MAnnour, is a thing 
compounde of dy­
uers thinges, as of a 
house, lande arrable, 
pasture, meadowe, 
woode, rent, auow­
son, court baron, and 
such like make a man­
nor, and this ought to 
be by long continuance 
of time, to the contra­
rie whereof mans me­
mory cannot tell, for 
at this day a mannor 
cannot be made, because 
a court baron cannot 
nowe be made, and a 
manner cannot be with­
out a court baron, and 
suters, or freeholders, 
two at the least, for if 
all the freeholdes ex­
cept one eschete to the 
lord, or if he purchase 
al except one, there his 
manor is gone, for that it 
cannot be a manor without 

 

a court Baron (as is 
aforesaid) & a court ba­
ron cannot be holden 
but before sutors, and 
not before one suter, & 
therefore where but 
one freeholde or free­
holder is, there cannot 
be a mannor.
 
¶ Manumission
MAnumission is in 
ij. sorts, the one is 
a manumission expres­
sed, the other a manu­
mission implyed or se­
create. 
 
Manumission ex­
pressed is when the lord 
maketh a deede to hys 
villein to enfraunches 
him by this word (Ma­
numittere) which is as 
much to say as to let 
one goe out of an o­
ther mans handes or 
power. 
 
The manner of ma­
numitting or infran­
chisinge in olde time 
moste vsually was 

 

thus. The Lorde (in 
presence of his neigh­
bors) toke the bonde 
man by the heade say­
ing, I will that thys 
man be free, and there­
with shewed him for­
ward out of his hands, 
& by this he was free 
without any more a 
do. Manumission im­
plyed without thys 
worde (Manumittere) is 
when the lord maketh 
an obligation to hys 
villein to pay him mo­
ney at a certein day, or 
sueth him where hee 
might enter without 
sute, or graunteth vn­
to his villein an annu­
ity, or lesseth lande 
to hym by deede for 
yeres or for life, and in 
diuers such like cases, 
the villein thereby is 
made free.
 
¶ Maximes.
MAximes bee the 
foundations of the 

 

law, and the conclusi­
ons of reason, and are 
causes efficient, & cer­
tein vniuersal propo­
sitions so sure and per­
fect that they may not 
be at any time impea­
ched or impugned, but 
ought alwayes to bee 
obserued and holden 
as strong principalles 
and aucthorities of them
selues although they 
cannot be proued by 
force of argument or 
demonstrations logi­
cal, but are knowen by 
enduction by the way 
of sence and memory. 
As for example, it is 
a maxime that if a man 
haue issue ij. sonnes 
by dyuers women, 
and the one of them 
purchase landes in fee 
and dyeth wythout 
issue, the other bro­
ther shall neuer be is 
heire &c. 
 
Also it is an other 
maxime that lands shal 
discend from the father 

 

to the sonne, but not 
from the sonne to the 
father for that is an 
ascention &c. & diuers 
such like there be.
 
¶ Maynour.
MAynour is when 
a theefe hath sto­
len, and is followed 
wyth hue and crye, 
and taken, hauinge 
that founde about him 
which he stole, that is 
called the maynour. 
And so we common­
lye vse to saye when 
we finde one doing of 
an vnlawfull act, that 
wee tooke him wyth 
the mainour, or man­
ner.
 
¶ Misprision.
MIsprision, is when on 
knoweth that another 
hath committed treason 
or felony, and wil not 
discouer him to the Q 
or to her Councell 

 

or to any Magistrate, 
but doth conceale the 
same. 
 
A Chaplein had fixed 
an olde seale of a pa­
tent to a new patent 
of Non residence, and 
thys was holden to 
be a Misprision of trea­
son onelye, and no 
counterfayting of the 
Queenes seale. 
 
Also if a man know 
money to be counter­
fait, & bring the same 
out of Ireland hither 
into England, & vtter 
it in payment, thys is 
but misprision of trea­
son, & no Treason, & 
so it is in dyuers such 
lyke cases. 
 
And in all cases of 
misprision of Treason 
the party offendor shal 
forfait his goodes for 
euer, and the profites 
of his landes for terme 
of hys life, and hys 
bodie to pryson at the 
Queenes pleasure. 
 
And for Misprision 

 

of felonie trespasse, 
the offendour shal bee 
committed to pryson 
vntil hee haue founde 
suerties or pledges for 
his true, which shalbee 
assessed by the discretion 
of the Iustices before 
whom he was conuict. 
 
And note that in e­
uery Treason or fe­
lonie is included mis­
prision. & where any 
harm committed trea­
son or felony, the Q. 
may cause the same to 
be indicted & arrayned 
but of Misprision on­
ly if she will
 
¶ Shewing of deedes. 
or Recordes.
SHewinge of deedes 
or recordes, is as if 
for example, an action 
of dette be brought a­
gainst one vpon an ob­
ligation, or by executors 
&c. there after that the 
plaintif hath declared, 

 

he ought to shew hys 
obligation, or the exe­
cutor the testament to 
the court, and so it is 
of Recordes. 
 
And the diuersitie 
betwene shewinge of 
deedes or Recordes, & 
hearing of deedes or 
recordes, is thus, he that
pleads the deede or re­
cord, or declares vpon 
it. to him it doth ap­
pertaine to shew the 
same. And the other a­
gainst whom such dede 
or record is pleaded or 
declared, & is thereby 
to be charged, may de­
maunde hearing of the 
same deede or recorde, 
which his aduersarie 
bringeth or pleadeth 
against him.
 
¶ Mortgage or Morgage.
MOrtgage or Mor­
gage, is when a man
maketh a feoffement to 
another on such con­
dicion that if the feffor 

 

pay to the feoffee at a 
certeine day xl. ii. of 
money, that then the 
feoffor may reenter &c., 
in this case the feoffee 
is called tenant in mor­
gage. And as a man 
may make a feoffement 
in fee in Morgage, so 
he may make a gift in 
taile, or a lease for 
terme of lyfe, or for 
terme of yeres in mor­
gage. And it seemeth 
that the cause why it 
is called Mortgage, is 
for that it standeth in 
doubt, whether the 
feoffor will pay the mo­
ney at the day appoin­
ted or not, & if he faile 
to pay, then the lande 
which he laied in gage 
vpon condicion of pai­
ment of the money, is 
gon from him for euer 
& so dead to him vpon 
condicion: but if he pay 
the money, then is the 
gage dead as to the te­
nant, that is to say, the 
feoffee, & for this cause 

 

it is called in Latine 
Mortuum vadium, as 
master Littleton saieth, 
or rather mortuum vas, 
as I thinke.
 
¶ Mortmaine.
MOrtmayne was 
when lands were 
geeuen to a house of 
religion, or to a com­
pany which be corpo­
rate by the Kinges 
graunt, then the land 
is come into mortmain 
that is to say in Eng­
lish a dead hand, & the 
kinge or the Lorde of 
whom the lande is 
holden may enter into 
them.
 
¶ Mulier.
MUlier, is a woorde 
vsed in our lawe, 
but how aptly I can­
not tell, nor do well 
know howe it should 
come in that sence as 
we there take it: For 

 

according to the pro­
per signification. Mu­
lier is a defiled woman 
lyke as it is vsed by 
Vlpianus, in a cer­
teine place after thys 
sort. If I thought that
I had bought a Vir­
gine, when it was a 
defyled woman, the 
bargain was not good, 
Hereby you may see, 
that Mulier is a woman that
hath had the companie 
of a man. But to leaue 
the right signification. 
Mulier is taken in our 
law for one that is law­
fully begotten & borne: 
& is alwaies vsed in 
comparison with a bas­
tarde, onely to shew 
a difference beetwene 
them, as thus for ex­
ample. A man hath a 
sonne by a woman be­
fore mariage, that is 
called a bastarde, and 
vnlawfull. And after 
they entermarie and 
haue an other sonne, 
this ij. sonne is called 

 

Mulier, that is to say 
lawfull, and shalbee 
heire to hys father: 
but that other cannot 
be heire to any man, 
because it is not kno­
wen nor certein in the 
iudgement of the law, 
who was his father, 
and for that cause is 
saide to bee no manes 
sonne, or the sonne of 
the people, and so 
without father, ac­
cordinge to thys olde 
Verse. 
 
To whom the people 
father is, to him is fa­
ther none and all. 
 
To whom the peo­
ple father is, well fa­
therlesse wee may him 
call. 
 
And alwayes you 
shall finde this addi­
tion to them, (Bas­
terd eldest, & mulier 
yongest) when they 
bee compared toge­
ther.
 
¶ Murder. 


 

MVrder is a wil­
ful killinge of a 
man vpon ma­
lice forethought and 
seemeth to come of the 
Saxon word Mordren
which so signifieth: & 
Mordridus, is the mur­
derer euen vntil this 
day amonge them in 
Saxonie, from whence 
wee haue most of our 
wordes as hath bene 
often said.
 
¶ Negatiua preignans.
NEgatiua pregnans 
is when an acty­
on, or information, or 
such like is brought 
against one, and the 
defendant pleadeth in 
barre of the action, or 
otherwise, a negatiue 
plea which is not so 
speciall an aunswere 
to the actyon, but that 
it includeth also an 
Affyrmatiue. As for 
example: If hee in 
reuersion enter vppon 

 

tenant for life suppo­
singe that hee hath a­
liened in fee (which 
is a forfaiture of his 
estate) and the te­
naunt for life sayeth 
that hee hath not ali­
ened in fee, this is a 
negatiue wherin is in­
cluded an affirmatiue: 
for althoughe it bee 
true, that he hath not 
alyened in fee: yet it 
may be that hee hath 
made an estate in taile 
(which is also a for­
faiture) and then the 
entrie of him in the re­
uersion is lawfull &c. 
Also in a Quare impe­
dit the Queene makes 
tytle to present to a 
Prebend for that the 
Temporalties of the 
Bishopricke were in 
her hands by the deth 
of W. late Bishop &c. 
The defendant saieth 
that it was not voide 
being the temporairies 
in the queens hands by 
the death of W. this is 

 

a negatiue preignans, 
for it may bee in the 
queens hands other­
wise then by the deathe 
of W. and it suffiseth 
the queene if it bee in 
her handes by anye 
meanes &c. So it is 
where an Information
was brought in the 
escheker against I. 
Stile, for that hee 
bought wool betwene 
shering time & the as­
sumption, such a yeare 
of Iohn N. The de­
fendant saith that hee 
did not buy any of I. 
N. as it is alledged 
&c. this is called a ne­
gatiue preignans, for 
if he bought it of any 
other, yet he is culpa­
ble for the buyinge.
 
¶ Niefe.
NIefe is a woman 
that is bonde, or a 
villen woman, but if 
shee marie a free man 

 

she as thereby made 
free for euer (although 
that her husband dye 
and she suruiue him) 
because that she and 
her husband ar but one 
person in law, and she 
ought to be of the same 
nature and condition 
in lawe to al intents 
that her husbande is. 
But her husbande is 
free to al intents without 
any condition in lawe 
or otherwise, and so 
by consequens the wife 
ought to be, and is free 
accordinge to the na­
ture of her fre husband 
& then if she were once 
free and clerelye dis­
charged of bondage to 
al entents, she can not 
be niefe after without 
especiall acte done by 
her, as diuorce, or con­
fession in court of re­
cord, and that is in fa­
uor of liberty, & there­
fore a free woman shal 
not be bound by taking 
of a villen to her husband 

 

But their issue shalbe 
villeines as their fa­
ther was, which is 
contrary to the Ciuile 
law, for there it is said 
the birth followeth the
belly. Bondage or vil­
lenage had beginning 
among the Hebrewes 
& his original procee­
ding of Canaan the sonne 
of Cham, who because 
that he had mocked his 
father Noe to scorne, 
lying desolutely when 
he was drunke, was 
punished in hys sonne 
Chanaan with penal­
tie of bondage.
 
¶ Nihil dicit.
NIhil dicit, is when 
an action is brought 
against a man, and the 
defendant appeares, the 
plaintife declares, and 
the def. will not aun­
swere, or pledes to the 
action, & doth not main­
tain his ple, but makes 
defaut, now vpon this 

 

defaut, he shalbe con­
dempned, because hee 
sayeth nothing.
 
¶ Nomination.
NOmination, ys 
where one may in 
right of his manor or 
otherwise, nominate 
and appoint a worthy 
clerke or man to a par­
sonage, vicarage, or 
such like spirituall 
promocion.
 
¶ Nonabilitie.
NOnabilitie, ys 
where an action is 
brought against one, & 
the defendaunt sayeth 
that the plaintife is not 
able to sue any actyon 
& demaundeth iudge­
ment if he shalbe aun­
swered. There are vj. 
causes of nonabilitie 
in the plaintife, as if 
he be an outlaw, or an 
alien borne, but that 
disability is in actions 

 

reales and mixt onely 
and not in actyons 
personalles, except 
hee bee an alien ene­
mye, or condempned 
in premunire, or pro­
fessed in religion, that 
is to saye, the Romish 
religion, or accursed, 
or a villen and sueth 
hys Lorde, but this 
last is noe ple for an 
other that is not lord to 
the villen.
 
¶ Bare, or naked contract.
BAre Contract, or 
naked promise, is 
where a man bargay­
neth or selleth hys 
lands, or goods, or pro­
miseth to geeue to one 
money, or a horse, or to 
buylde a house, or doe 
such a thing at such a 
day, & there is no recom­
pence appoynted to 
him for the doing there­
of. As if one say to an 
other I sel or geeue to 
you al my lands or goodz 

 

And there is nothing 
appointed, assigned, or 
agreed vpon, what the 
other shal geeue or pay 
for it, so that there is 
not one thing for ano­
ther, this is a naked 
contract, and voyde in 
law, & for not perfor­
mance therof no action 
lieth, for of a naked con­
tract cometh no action.
 
¶ Oredelfe.
ORedelfe is where 
one claimes to haue 
the ore that is founde 
in his soile or ground.
 
¶ Outfangthiefe.
OVtfangthiefe, that 
is, that theues or fe­
lones of your lande, or 
fee, out of your land, or 
fee taken with felonie 
or a stealinge, shalbee 
brought backe to your 
Court, and there 
iudged.

 

¶ Oweltie.
OWeltie, is when 
there is Lord, mes­
ne, and tenant, and the 
tenant holdeth of the 
meine by the same ser­
uices, that the mesne 
holdeth ouer of the lord 
aboue him. As if the 
tenant hold of the mes­
ne by homage, fealtie & 
xx. s. of rent yerely, 
and the mesne hol­
deth ouer of the Lord 
aboue by homage, fe­
altie, and xx shyl­
lynges rent also, this 
is called Owelty of 
seruices.
 
¶ Hearing of Recordes 
and deedes &c.
HEaring of records 
and deedes is, if for 
example, an action of 
det be brought against 
a man vpon an obliga­
tion, & the defendaunt 
appeares to the action, 
& then prayeth that he 

 

may heare the obliga­
tion where with the 
plaintif chargeth him. 
 
So it is when as 
executors bring an ac­
tion of det, & the defen­
dant demaundeth to 
heare the testament, vp­
pon this demaunde it 
shalbee reade vnto the 
defendaunt. But if 
it bee in ann other 
terme or after that 
the defendaunt hath 
imparled, then he shal 
not heare it. And so 
as is sayde of deedes, 
is to bee vnderstoode 
of recordes that are 
alleaged against him.
 
¶ Pape.
PApe is an auncyent 
name falsely arro­
gated, or proudly v­
surped by the By­
shop of the onely Ci­
tle of Roome in Ita­
lie, and is common­
ly Englished the Pope, 
a name truely much 

 

frequented in our an­
cient yeare books, spe­
cially in the times of 
those kinges, who to 
much abandoning their 
imperiall auctoritye, 
and abasinge them 
selues far beneth their 
estate, were not asha­
med to suffer an alyen 
and outlandish Bis­
shoppe, that dwelt a­
boue fiftene hundrede 
miles from them, to be 
soueraigne ouer them 
in theyr owne domy­
nions, and to take from
them not onelye the 
disposition of certeine 
small trifles of none 
accompte, but also the 
nominacion of Arch­
bishoppes, Bishopps, 
Abbots, Deanes, pro­
uosts, appropriations 
of benefices, presenta­
tions to personages, 
vicarages, and gene­
rally of all spirituall 
persons to their prefer­
ments sometimes by 
lapse, and sometymes 

 

otherwise wherebye 
the kinges princelye 
Prerogatiue was ve­
rye muche abridged 
within their owne 
Realmes.
 
¶ Partition.
PArtition is a deuy­
dinge of landes dis­
cended by the common 
lawe, or by custome 
amonge coheires or 
parceners wher there 
be ij. at the least whe­
ther they bee sonnes, 
daughters, sisters auntz 
or otherwise of kinne 
to the auncestor from 
whom the land discen­
ded to them. 
 
And this particy­
on is made iiij. waies 
for the most part, 
whereof three are at 
pleasure and by agree­
ment amonge them, 
the fourth is by com­
pulsion. 
 
One partition by a­
greement is when they 
them selues deuide the 

 

lande equally into so 
many partes, as there 
bee of them coparce­
ners, and each to chose 
one share or parte, the 
eldest first, and so the 
one after other, as 
they bee of age, except 
that the eldest by con­
sent make the partici­
on, then the choice be­
longeth to the next, & 
so to the eldest last, 
according as it is said 
Who so maketh the 
partition, the other 
must haue the choice. 
 
An other partition 
by agreement is when 
they choose certain of 
their frends to make 
diuision for them. 
 
The thirde partici­
on by agreement is by 
drawing of lots thus: 
first to deuide the land 
into so many parts as 
there bee parceners, 
then to writt euerye 
parte seuerrallye in a 
little scrole, or peece 
of paper or parchment 

 

and to put the same 
scrolles vp close into 
a hate, capp, or other 
such like thinge, and 
then ech parcener, one 
after an other as they 
bee of age to drawe 
out thereof one peece 
or scrolle wherein is 
written a part of the 
lande which by this 
drawinge is now se­
ueralye alotted vnto 
them in fee simple. 
 
The fowereth par­
tition which is by com­
pulsion is when one 
or some of the copar­
ceners would haue 
partition and other 
some will not agree 
thereto, then they that 
so would haue parti­
cion may bring a writ 
de particione facienda a­
gainst the others that 
would not make par­
tition, by vertu wher 
of they shal be compel­
led to depart &c. Wee 
in Kent (Brother 
Nicholas (where the 

 

landes are of Gauel­
kinde nature, cal at 
this day our particy­
on Shifting euen the 
very same word that 
the Saxons vsed nam­
ly (Shiftan) which signi­
fieth to make particion
betwene coheires, and 
to assigne to eache of 
them their portion, in 
latyn it is called Her­
ciscere.
 
¶ Parties.
PArties to a fine, or 
deede, are those that 
leuy the same fine, and 
also they to whom the 
fine is leuied: And 
they that make a deede 
of feoffement, and they 
to whom it is made are 
called parties to the 
deede, & so in any other 
like cases.
 
¶ Patron. 


 

PAtron is he that hath 
a personage, vyca­
rage, free chappell, or 
such like spiritual pro­
motion belonging to 
his mannor, and may 
or ought to giue the 
same benefice when 
and as often as it fal­
leth voyde. And thys 
being patron, or patro­
nage had beginninge 
for the most part by 
one of these iij. waies, 
namely eyther by rea­
son of the foundaty­
on, for that the patron 
or hys auncestours, or 
those from whom hee 
claymes were foun­
ders or buylders of 
the Churche, or by 
reason of Dotation, 
for that they did en­
dowe or geue landes 
to the same for main­
tenaunce thereof, or 
els by reason of the 
grounde because the 
Churche was set or 
builded vpon their soile 
or grounde: and many 

 

times by reason of the 
al three.
 
¶ Perquisites.
PErquisites are ad­
uauntages and pro­
fittes that come to a 
mannor by casualty, & 
not yearely: as Es­
cheates, Hariotes, 
Relyefes, wayfes, 
strayes forfaytures, 
amercements in courts, 
wardes, maryages, 
goods and landes pur­
chases by villaines of 
the same mannor, and 
diuers such like things 
that are not certeine 
but happen by chaun­
ce, sometymes more 
often then at other 
tymes.
 
¶ Plaintife.
PLayntife is hee 
that sueth or com­
playneth in an assyse 
or in an actyon per­

 

sonall, as in an acti­
on of det, trespas, dis­
ceyt, detinue, and such 
other.
 
¶ Pleading.
PLeadinge is that 
which commeth after 
the count, namly that 
which is contained in 
the barre, replication, 
and reioinder, and not 
that contayned in the 
count it selfe, & there­
fore defaultes in the 
matter of the Count 
are not comprised within
mispleading, or insuf­
ficient pleadinge, nor 
are remedied by the sta­
tute of Ieofailes: But 
only that mispleading, 
or insufficyent plea­
ding, committed in the 
barre, replication, and 
reioinder, are there 
prouided for.
 
¶ Pound.

 

POundes are in two 
sorts, the one pounds 
open, the other pounds 
close. 
 
Pounde open, is 
euery place wherein a 
distresse is put, whe­
ther it bee common 
pounde such as are in 
euery towne or lorde­
ship, or whether it bee 
backside, Court, yard, 
pasture, or els what­
soeuer, whether the 
owner of the distresse 
may come to geue them
meate & drinke with­
out offence for their 
being there, or his com­
ming thither. 
 
Pound Close is such 
a place, where the ow­
ner of the distresse may 
not come to geue them 
meat and drinke, with 
out offence, as in a 
close house, or whatso­
euer els place.
 
¶ Possession.

 

POssession is said two 
wayes, eyther actu­
all possession, or posses­
sion in law. 
 
Actuall possession, 
is when a man entreth 
in deede into landes or 
tenements to him dis­
cended, or otherwise. 
Possession in lawe is 
when landes or tene­
ments are discended 
to a man, and he hath 
not as yet really, ac­
tually, and in deede en­
tred into them. And it 
is called possession in 
lawe, because that in 
the eye, and considera­
tion of the lawe, hee 
is deemed to be in pos­
session, for asmuch as 
he is tenaunt to euery 
mans action that will 
sue concernynge the 
same landes, or tene­
ments.
 
¶ Preamble.
PReamble taketh his 
name of the preposi­

 

tion (Pre) before, and 
ther verbe (Ambulo) to 
goe, so ioyned toge­
ther, they make a com­
pounde verbe of the 
first coniugation (Pre­
ambulo) to go before, 
& hereof the first parte 
or beginning of an act, 
is called the preamble 
of the act, which pre­
amble is a key to open 
the mindes of the ma­
kers of the acte, & the 
mischiefes that they 
intende to remedy by 
the same, as for exam­
ple the statute made at 
Westminster the first, 
the 37. chapter which 
giueth an attaint, the pre­
amble of which is thus. 
For asmuch as certein 
people of this realme, 
dout very little to giue 
false verdicts or othes, 
which they ought not 
to do, whereby many 
people  are disherited & 
lose their right, it is 
prouided &c.

 

¶ Prescription.
PRescription is when
one hath had or v­
sed any thinges sithe 
the time whereof no 
minde is to the con­
trary.
 
¶ Presentment.
PResentment is when
a man which hath 
right to geeue a bene­
fice spirituall nameth 
the person to whome 
he wil giue it, and ma­
keth a writing to the 
Bishop for him, that 
is a presentation or 
presentment.
 
¶ Pretensed right or 
Title.
PRetensed right or 
title is where one 
is in possession of lands, 
or tenementes, and an 
other who is out of 
possession, claimeth it, 
or sueth for it. Nowe 

 

the pretensed right or 
title is sayde in him, 
whoe so doth sue or 
claim. And if he after­
ward come to the pos­
session of the same lands, 
or tenements, his right 
or title is extincte, or 
suspended in the land.
 
¶ Priuie or Priuitie, and 
Priuies.
PRiuie, or priuity is 
wher a lease is made 
to holde at will, for 
yeres, for life, or a fef­
fement in fee, & in dy­
uers other cases, now 
because of thys that 
hath passed betweene 
these parties, they are 
called priuies, in res­
pect of straungers be­
twene whom no such 
dealings, or conueian­
ces hath ben. 
 
Also if there be lord 
and tenaunt, and the 
tenaunt holdeth of the 
Lorde by certeyn ser­
uyce, there is a pri­

 

uitie betwene them be­
cause of the tenure, & if 
the tenaunt bee dissei­
sed by a straunger, there 
is no priuity betwene 
the disseisor & the lord, 
but the priuity stil re­
maineth betwene the 
Lord and the tenaunt 
that is disseysed, and 
the Lord shall auowe 
vpon him, for that hee 
is his tenant in right 
and in the iudgement 
of the lawe, Priuies 
are in diuers sorts, as 
namely priuies in es­
tate, priuies in deede, 
priuies in law, priuies 
in right, and priuies in 
blood. 
 
Priuies in estate is 
where a lease is made 
of the manor of dale to 
A. for life, the remain­
der to B. in fee, there 
both A. and B. are pri­
uies in estate, for their 
estates were bothe 
made at one time. And 
so is it in the first case 
heare where a lease is 

 

made at will, for life 
or yeares or a feoffe­
ment in fee, the lessees 
or feffees, are called 
priuies in estate, and 
soe are their heires 
&c. 
 
Priuies in deed is 
where a lease is made 
for life, and afterward 
by an other deede the 
reuersion is graunted 
to a straunger in fee, 
thys grauntee of the 
reuersion is called 
pryuie in deede, bee­
cause that he hath the 
reuersion by deede. 
 
Priuie in lawe is 
where there is Lord & 
tenant, the tenant les­
seth the tenauncy for 
life and dieth without 
heire, & the reuersion 
escheates to the lorde, 
he is said priuy in law 
beecause that he hath 
his estate onely by the 
lawe, that is to say by 
escheate. 
 
Priuie in ryght, is 
where on possessed of a 

 

terme for yeres, grants 
his estate to another 
vpon condicion, and 
maketh his executors 
& dyeth, now these ex­
ecutors are priuies in 
right, for if the condi­
cion be broken, & they 
enter into the lande, 
they shal haue it in the 
right of their testator, 
& to his vse. Priuie of 
bloode is the heire of the 
feoffor or donor &c. 
 
Also if a fine bee le­
uied, the heires of him 
that leuyeth the fine 
are called priuies.
 
¶ Priuiledges.
PRiuiledges are ly­
berties and fraun­
chises graunted to an 
Office, place, towne, 
or mannour, by the 
Queenes great char­
ter, letters patentes, 
or acte of Parliament, 
as Tolle, sake, socke, 
Infangtheefe, Out­
fangtheefe, Turne 

 

tolle, Oredelfe, and 
dyuers such lyke, for 
which looke in theyr 
proper titles and pla­
ces.
 
¶ Next friende.
NExt friende and 
wardeine in So­
cage is all one, and is 
where a manne seysed 
of landes holden in 
Socage dyeth, hys is­
sue within age of 14. 
yeares, then the next 
friende, or next of 
kynne to whom the 
lands cannot come or 
discende, shall haue 
the keepynge of the 
heire, & of the land, to 
the onely vse of the 
heire, vntyll he come 
to the age of xiiij. yeres, 
& then at that yeres he 
may enter & put hym 
out. & bring him to ac­
compt: but in that ac­
compt he shalbe allo­
wed for all reasona­
ble costes & expences, 

 

bestowed eyther vpon 
the heire or his land. 
 
And the next friend 
or next of kynne to 
whom the inhery­
taunce cannot dys­
cende, is thus to bee 
vnderstoode: If the 
landes discende to the 
heyre from hys fa­
ther, or anye of the 
kynne of hys fathers 
side: then the mother, 
or other of the mo­
thers side, are called 
the next of kynne to 
whom the inheritance 
cannot dyscende, for 
before that it shal so 
dyscende, it shall ra­
ther Escheat to the 
Lorde of whom it is 
holden. And so it is 
to bee vnderstoode, 
where the landes 
came to the Heyre 
from hys Mother, 
or any of the kynne 
of hys mothers syde: 
Then the father or o­
ther of the fathers 
side, are called the next 

 

of kynne to whom the 
inheritaunce cannot 
discende: but shal ra­
ther escheat to the 
Lorde of whome it is 
holden.
 
¶ Protestation.
PRotestation is a sa­
uinge to the partie 
(that so pleadeth by 
protestation) to bee 
concluded by any mat­
ter alledged or obiec­
ted against him, vpon
which he cannot ioin 
issu: And is no other 
thing but an exclusion 
of the conclusion, for 
hee that taketh the 
protestation excludes 
the other party to con­
clude hym. And this 
protestatyon ought to 
stande wyth the se­
quele of the plee, & not 
to be repugnaunt, or 
otherwise contrary.
 
¶ Purchase.

 

PUrchase is the pos­
session that a man 
hath in lands or tene­
ments by his owne act 
meanes or agreement, 
and not by title of dis­
cent, from any of hys 
auncestors.
 
¶ Quarentine.
QUarentine, ys 
where a man dy­
eth seysed of a man­
nour, place, and other 
landes whereof hys 
wife ought to bee en­
dowed, then the wo­
man shal hold the ma­
nour place xl. dayes, 
within whiche tyme 
her dower shalbee as­
signed. But if shee 
marrie within the xl. 
dayes, she shall loose 
her quarentine.
 
¶ Fifteene.
FIfteene, is a pay­
ment graunted in 
Parliament to the 

 

Queene, by the tem­
poraltie, namely the 
15. part of their goods: 
And was vsed in aun­
cient time to be leuied 
vppon their cattel go­
yng in their grounds, 
which thynge was 
very troublesome, and 
therefore nowe for the 
most part, that way 
is alltered, and they 
vse to leuy the same 
by the yarde, or Acre 
or other measure of land 
By meanes where of 
it is now lesse trouble­
some, and more certen, 
then before it was. 
And euery towne and 
countrey doe knowe, 
what summe is to bee 
paied amonge them, & 
how the same shalbee 
raised. We read that 
Moyses was the first 
that did number the peo­
ple, for he numbred the 
Israelites, & therefore 
the first taxe, subsidye, 
tribute, or fiftene was 
inuented by him among 

 

the Hebrewes, as Po­
lidor Virgill dothe 
thinke.
 
¶ Regrator.
REgrator is he that 
hath corne, vitails 
or other things suffi­
cient for hys owne 
necessarie neede, occu­
pation, or spending, & 
doth neuerthelesse en­
grosse and buy vp in­
to his handes more 
Corne, vittailes, or o­
ther such thinges, to 
the intent to sell the 
same again at a higher 
and deerer price, in 
Faires, Markets, or 
such like places.
 
¶ Reioynder.
REioynder, is when 
the defendant ma­
keth aunswere to the 
Replication of the 
plaintife. 
 
And euery reioinder 
ought to haue these 

 

two properties speci­
ally, that is to say, it 
ought to be a sufficy­
ent aunswere to the 
Replication and also 
to follow and enforce 
the matter of the 
barre.
 
¶ Relyfe.
RElife is sometims 
a certein some of 
money that the heire 
shal pay to the lord of 
whom those lands are 
holden, which after 
the decease of his aun­
cestour are to him dis­
cended as next heire: 
sometimes it is the 
paiement of an other 
thinge, and not mony: 
And therefore reliefe 
is not certaine, and a­
like for all tenures, 
but euery sundry te­
nure hath (for the most 
part) hys specyall 
Reliefe certaine in it 
selfe. Neyther is it to 
be paied alwaies at a 

 

certaine age, but vari­
eth there also accor­
dinge to the tenure. 
As if the tenant had 
lands holden by knights 
seruice (except great 
Sergeancy) and dye 
his heire being of full 
age, and helde his lande 
by the seruice of a whole 
knightes fee, the lorde 
of whom that landes 
are so holden shal haue 
of the heire C.s. in 
the name of reliefe, & 
if he held by lesse then 
a knightes fee, he shall 
pay lesse, & if more then
more, hauinge respect 
alwaies to the rate 
for euery knightes fee 
an honored shillings. 
And if hee helde by 
Graunde Serieancye 
(which is alwayes 
of the Queene, and is 
also Knyghtes ser­
uice) thent he reliefe 
shall bee the value of 
the lande by the yere, 
beesides all charges is­
suing out of the same. 

 

Reliefe that the lord 
shall haue for landes 
holden in Socage, is 
so much more as the 
rent that the tenaunt 
holdeth his lande in 
Socage by, as if hee 
holde by a penny rent 
and dye, the lorde shal 
haue that penny rent, 
and a penny ouer for 
relife, of what age so­
euer the tenant be, at 
the death of his aun­
cestour. And note that 
in some cases the lord 
shall haue his reliefe 
immediatly after the 
death of his tenant, if 
it so be, that the time 
of the yere wil suffre the 
same to be gotten, as 
mony, corne, flesh, fish, 
spices, or any such like 
& for default of paye­
ment, the lorde maye 
therefore of common 
right presently distrein 
 
But in some ca­
ses the lord must stay 
for hys reliefe a cer­
taine time when neces­

 

sitye so constraineth. 
As if the tenant helde 
by a rose, a cherry, a 
strawberry, or such like 
and dye in winter, he 
shal not haue reliefe 
til roses, cherries, and 
straweberries are na­
turally fresh and ripe, 
which is about Mid­
somer, and then he shall 
haue one for rent, and 
an other for reliefe. 
 
There is an other 
kinde of reliefe that is 
paied after the death 
change, or alienation 
of freholders that hold 
in auncient demesne, 
and otherwise, and is 
paied as a knowledge 
of the tenure betwen 
the lord and the tenant. 
The same is not cer­
taine how much, but 
doth varye accordinge 
to the custome of the 
mannor, or tenure and 
is to be presented by 
the Homage or Su­
tors at the next court 
day of the same manor 

 

And note that al­
waies when the relief 
is due, it must be paid 
at one whole payment 
and not by partes, al­
though that the rent 
be to be paied at seue­
ral feastes.
 
¶ Remainder.
REmainder of lande 
is the land that shal 
remaine after the par­
ticuler estate determi­
ned: As if one graunt 
land for terme of yeres 
or for lyfe, the re­
mainder to I.S. that 
is to say, that when the 
lease for yeres is deter­
mined, or lessee for life 
is dead, that then the land 
shal remain, shalbe, or 
abide, with, to, or in I.S.
 
¶ Replication.
REplication is when 
the defendant in a­
ny action maketh an 
aunswere, & the plaintif 
maketh an aunswere 

 

to that, that is called 
the Replication of the 
plaintife.
 
¶ Reprises.
REprises, are deduc­
tions, paymentes, 
and duities that goe 
yearely and are payed 
out of a mannor. As 
rent charge, rent 
secke, pencions, co­
rodies, annuities, and 
such lyke.
 
.¶ Resceipt.
REsceipt, is when 
an action is brought 
against the tenant for 
terme of life, or tenant 
for terme of yeares, 
and he in the reuersion 
commeth in and pray­
eth to be receyued to 
defende the land, and 
to pleade with the de­
maundant. And when 
he commeth it behoo­
ueth that he be alway 

 

readie to plede wyth 
the demaundant.
 
¶ Reseruation.
REseruation, is ta­
ken diuers waies, 
and hath diuers na­
tures, as sometimes 
by way of exception 
to keepe that whych 
a man had before in 
him, as if a lease bee 
made for yeares of 
ground reseruing the 
great trees growyng 
vpon the same, now 
the lessee may not medle 
with them, nor wyth 
any thinge that com­
meth by reason of them
so long as it abydeth 
in, or vpon the trees, 
as mast of Oke, chest­
nutt, apples, or such 
like, but if they fal from
the trees to the ground, 
then they are in right 
the lessees, for the ground 
is let to him, & al there 
vpon not reserued &c. 
 
Sometimes a reser­

 

uation doth get and 
bring forth an other 
thing which was not 
before. As if a man 
lease his lands, reser­
uing yerely for the same 
xx. li. &c. And dyuers 
other such reseruati­
ons there be. 
 
And note that in 
auncient tyme, theyr 
reseruations were as 
wel (or for the more 
part) in vittaills, 
whether flesh, fishe, 
corne, bread, drinke, or 
what els, as in money 
vntil at the last, & that 
chefely in the Raigne 
of king H. the first by 
agreement, the reser­
uation of vittals was 
chaunged into ready 
money, as it hath hy­
therto since continued.
 
¶ Retraxit.
REtraxit, is the pre­
terperfect tence of re­
traho, compound of 
Re and traho, which 
make Retraho, to pull 

 

backe. And is when 
the partie plaintife or 
demaundant commeth 
in proper person into 
the Court where hys 
plee is, and sayth that 
he wil not proceed any 
farder in the same &c. 
now this shalbe a barr 
to the action for euer.
 
¶ Reeue.
REeue is an officer, 
but more knowen 
in auncient tyme then 
at this day. For al­
most euerie manor had 
then a Reeue, and yet 
still in many Copye 
holde manors (where 
the olde custome any 
thing preuayleth) the 
name and office is not 
altogether forgotten. 
And is in effect that 
which now euery bai­
life of a mannor prac­
tiseth: although the 
name of Bailife was 
not then in vre among 
vs being since brought 

 

in by the Normans: 
But the name of Reeue, 
auncyently called Ge­
reue, (which particle 
(Ge) in continuance of 
time was altogether 
left out and lost) came 
from the Saxon woord 
Geresa, which signyfi­
eth a ruler: And so in 
dede his rule & auctho­
ritie was large with­
in the compas of hys 
Lordes mannour and 
amonge his men and 
tenauntes as well in 
matters of gouerne­
ment in peace & warre, 
as in the skilfull vse 
and trade of husban­
dry: For as hee did ga­
ther his Lords rents, 
pay Reprises, or due­
tyes issuinge out of 
the mannor: set the 
seruauntes to worke, 
fell and cutt downe 
Trees to repaire the 
buildinges, and en­
closures, with dy­
uers such like for his 
Lordes commoditye: 

 

So also hee had auc­
thoritie to gouerne & 
keepe the tenaunts in 
peace, & if neede requi­
red, to leade the forth 
in warre.
 
¶ Reuersion.
REuersion of lande. 
is a certeine estate 
remaininge in the les­
sor or donor, after the 
particuler estate & pos­
session conueyed to an 
other. 
 
And it is called a re­
uersion in respecte of 
the possession sepera­
ted from it: so that hee 
that hath the one hath 
not the other at the 
same time, for being in 
one bodye together, 
there cannot be said a 
reuersion, because by the
vniting, the one of them
is drowned in the o­
ther: And so the re­
uersion of land, is the 
land it selfe when it 
saueth.

 

¶ Riot.
RIot is where three 
(at the least) or more 
do some vnlawful act: 
as to beate a manne, 
Enter vppon the pos­
session of an other, or 
such like.
 
¶ Robbery.
RObbery is when a 
man taketh any thing 
from the parson of an 
other feloniously, al­
though the thinge so 
taken be not to the va­
lue but of a peny, yet 
it is felony, for which 
the offendour shal suf­
fer death.
 
¶ Rout.
ROut, is when peo­
ple do assemble them 
selues together and 
after do proceede, or 
ride, or go foorth, or do 
moue by the instiga­
tion of one, or more, 

 

whoe is their lea­
der: Thys is called 
Rout, beecause they 
doo moue, and proceede 
in Routes and num­
bers. 
 
Also where many as­
semble them selues to­
gether vpon their owne 
quarrels & braules, as 
if the inhabitants of a 
towne wil gather them
selues together, to 
breake hedges, wales, 
ditches pales, or such 
like to haue common 
there, or to beate ano­
ther that hath done to 
them a common displea­
sure or such like, that 
is a Rout & against the
lawe although they 
haue not done or put 
in execution their mis­
cheuous entent.
 
¶ Sake.
SAk, this is a plee and 
correctyon of tres­
pas of men in your 
court, because (Sak) 

 

in English is Achelon
in french, and Sak is 
put for Sik, as to say 
for sik sak, also for 
what hurt, & Sak is 
put for forfait.
 
¶ Scot.
SCot, that is to bee 
quite of a certeine 
custome, as of commen 
tallage made to the 
vse of the Sherife or 
Bailife.
 
¶ Shewinge.
SHewing that is to 
bee quite wyth at­
tachment in any court 
and before whomsoe­
uer in plaints shewed 
& not auowed.
 
¶ Sok.
SOk this is suite 
of menne in your 
court according to 
the custome of the Re­
alme.

 

¶ Sokmans.
SOkmans, are the te­
nants in auncient de­
mesne, that hold their 
lands in Socage, that 
is by seruice with the 
plough, and therefore 
they are called Sok­
mans, which is as 
much to saye, as te­
nauntes or men that 
hold by seruice of the 
plough, or plowmen. 
For Sok signifieth a 
plough. 
 
And these Sokmans 
or tenaunts in aunci­
ent demesne, haue ma­
ny and dyuers liber­
ties giuen & graunted 
to them by the lawe, 
as wel these tenaunts 
that holde of a com­
mon person in auncy­
ent demesne, as those 
that hold of the Queene 
in auncient demesne, 
as namely to bee free 
from payinge tolle 
in euerye Market, 
Faire, Towne, and 

 

City thoughout the 
whole Realme, aswel 
for their goods & cat­
tels that they sell to o­
thers, as for those thi­
ngs that they buy for 
their prouision, of other. 
And thereupon euery of 
them may sue to haue 
letters patents vnder 
the Queens seale direc­
ted to her officers, & to 
the Maires, Bailifes 
& other officers in the 
realme to suffer them to 
be tolle free. Also to be 
quite of pontage, mu­
rage & passage, as also 
of taxes and tallages 
graunted by parliament, 
except that the Queen 
taxe auncient demesne 
as she may at her plea­
sure for some great 
cause. Also to be free 
from paiments towards 
the expenses of the 
knightes of the shire that
come to the parliament. 
 
And if the sherif wil 
distreine them or any 
of them to bee con­

 

tributory for their 
lands in auncient de­
mesn, then one of them 
or al as the case requie­
reth may sue a write 
directed to the sherif com­
manding him that he doe 
not compel them to bee 
contributories to the ex­
penses of the knights, & 
the same writ doth com­
maund him also, that 
if he haue already dis­
trained them therfore 
that he redelyuer the 
same distresse. 
 
Also that they 
ought not to bee im­
panneled, nor put in 
in Iuries and enquests 
in the countrye out 
of theyr mannor or 
lordeshippe of auncy­
ent demesne, for the 
landes that they hold 
there (except that they 
haue other landes at 
the common lawe, for 
which they ought to 
be charged) and if the 
sherife do return them 
in panells, then they 

 

may haue a writte a­
gainst him de non po­
nendis in assisis & iura­
tis. And if he do the 
contrary, then lyeth 
an attachement vp­
on that against him. 
And so it is also, if the 
bailifes of franchises 
that haue returne of 
writtes will returne 
any of the tenaunts 
which hold in auncy­
ent demesne in assises 
or iuries. 
 
And also to be ex­
empt from leets, and 
the shirifs turne, with 
diuers other such like 
lyberties.
 
¶ Spoliation
SPoliation is a suit 
for the fruites of a 
church or for the church 
it selfe, and it is to bee 
sued in the spirytuall 
Court, and not in our 
courts. And this suit 
lieth for one incumbent 
against an other in­

 

cumbent, where they 
both claime by one pa­
tron, and where the 
right of the patronage 
doth not not come in 
question or debate. As 
if a person be created 
a bishoppe, and hath 
dispensation to keepe 
his benefice still, and 
afterward the patron 
presents an other in­
cumbent which is in­
stituted, and inducted: 
Nowe the Bishoppe 
may haue against that 
incumbent a Spolia­
tion in the spirituall 
Court, beecause they 
claime both by one pa­
tron, and the right of 
the patronage doth 
not come in debate, & 
because that the other 
incumbent came to the 
possession of the bene­
fice by the course of the 
spirituall law, that is 
to say by institution & 
induction, so that hee 
hath colour to haue it 
& be person by the es­

 

pritual law, for other 
wise if he be not insti­
tuted and inducted &c. 
Spoliation lieth not 
against him, but ra­
ther a writt of Tres­
pas, or an assise of no­
uel disseisin &c. 
 
So it is also where 
a personne doth accept 
an other benefice, by 
reason whereof the 
patrone presentes an 
other clerke who is 
instituted & inducted, 
now the one of them 
may haue Spoliation 
against the other, and 
then shal come in de­
bate if he haue plura­
lity or not. And so it 
is of depriuation &c. 
 
The same lawe, is 
where one saieth to the
patron, that his clerke is 
dead, where vppon he 
presentes an other: 
There the first in­
cumbent which was 
supposed to bee deade 
may haue a spoliation
against the other, & so 

 

in dyuers other such 
like cases.
 
¶ Stallage.
STallage that is to 
bee quite of a cer­
teine custome exacted 
for the streat taken or 
assigned in faires and 
markets.
 
¶ Suit couenant.
SUit couenaunt is 
when your aunces­
tors haue couenanted 
with my auncestours 
to sue to the court of 
my auncestors.
 
¶ Suit custome.
SUit custome is when
I and my aunces­
tours haue beene sei­
sed of your owne 
suite and your aun­
cestours, time out of 
minde &c.

 

¶ Suit riall.
SVit riall is when 
men come to the shi­
rifes tourne or leete, to 
which court al men shal 
be compelled to come to 
know the lawes, so that
they shal not be igno­
rant of the things that 
shalbe declared there 
howe they shalbe go­
uerned. And it is cal­
led rial suit because of 
their allegeance, & this 
appeareth by common 
experyence when one 
is sworne, his othe is 
that hee shalbe a loyall 
and faithfull man to 
the Queene. And this 
suit is not for the land 
which he holdeth within 
the Countie, but by 
reason of hys person, 
and his abode there, 
and ought to bee done 
twise a yeare, for de­
faut whereof, he shall 
be amerced & not dys­
trained.

 

¶ Suit seruice.
SUit seruice, is to 
sue to the Sherifes 
tourne or leete, or to 
the Lords court from 
three weekes to three 
weekes by the whole 
yeare, and for default 
thereof, a man shalbee 
distrayned and not a­
merced And this suit 
seruice is by reason of 
the tenure of a mans 
landes.
 
¶ Taxe and Tallage.
TAxe & Tallage, are 
paiments as tethes, 
fiftenthes, subsidyes, 
or such like graunted 
to the Queene by par­
liament. 
 
The tenants in aun­
cien demeane are quite 
of these taxes & talla­
ges graunted by par­
liament except that the 
Queene do taxe aun­
cient demesne, as shee 
may when she thinkes 

 

good for some great 
cause. See auncient 
demesne.
 
¶ Tenure in capite.
TEnure in Capite 
is where any hold 
at the Queene as of 
her personne beeinge 
Queene, and of her 
Crowne as of a Lord­
shippe by it selfe in 
grosse, and in chyefe 
aboue al other Lord­
shippes. And not 
where they hold of her 
as of any mannor, ho­
nor or castell, excepte 
certeine auncient ho­
nors, which appere in 
the Eschequer.
 
¶ Testament.
TEstament is thus 
defined or expoun­
ded in master Plow­
dens comentaries, a 
testament is the wit­
nes of the minde, and 
is compound of these 

 

two wordes. Testa­
tio & mentis, which so 
signifieth, trueth is, 
that a Testament is 
a witnes of the minde. 
but that it is a com­
pounde worde, Aulus 
Gellius in his vj. booke 
cap. 12. doth deny the 
same to an excellent 
Lawyer one Seruius 
Sulpicius, and sayeth 
that it is a simple 
worde, as are these: 
Calciamentum, Paluda­
mentum paumentum, 
and dyuers such like: 
And much lesse is a­
greamentum a com­
pounde worde of ag­
gregatio, and mentium
as is sayde beefore in 
that tytle, for there 
is noe suche latyne 
worde simple or com­
pounde, but it may 
neuer the lesse serue 
well for a lawe latyn 
worde. 
 
And therefore thus 
it may bee better de­
fined. A Testament 

 

is the true declara­
tion of our last wyll, 
of that we would to 
be don after out death 
&c. And of Testaments 
there be ij. sorts, name 
lye a Testament in 
writing, & a Testa­
ment by woords which 
is called a Nuncupa­
tiue testament. 
 
The first is alwayes 
in writing as is sayd. 
 
The other is when 
a man beeing sicke, and 
for feare least death or 
want of memorie, or 
of speach, should come 
so suddenly and haste­
ly vpon him that hee 
should be preuented if 
he stayed the writing 
of his testament, de­
sireth his neyghbours 
and friendes to beare 
witnesse of his laste 
will, and then decla­
reth the same present­
ly by wordes before 
them, which after his 
decease is prooued by 
wytnesses, and put 

 

in writing by the Or­
dinarie, & then stan­
eth in as good force, 
(except for lands) as 
if it had at the first in 
the life of the testator 
ben put in writing.
 
¶ Them.
THem, that is that 
you shall haue all 
the generations of your 
villaines wyth theyr 
suites & cattel where 
soeuer they shall bee 
found in England ex­
cept that if any bond­
man shal remain quite 
one yere and a day in 
any priuiledged town 
so that he shalbe recei­
ued into theyr Com­
minaltie or guild, as 
one of them, by that 
meanes hee ys dely­
uered from villenage.
 
¶ Thef bote.
THefbote, is when 
a man taketh any 

 

goodes of a theefe to 
fauour and mainteine 
him. And not when a 
man taketh his owne 
goodes that were stol­
len from him &c. The 
punishment in auncy­
ent time of theefebote 
was of lyfe and mem­
ber. But now at this 
day Master Stamforde 
sayeth, it is punished 
by raunsome, and im­
prisonment. But en­
quire farther, for I 
thinke it be felonie.
 
¶ Title.
TItle, is where a 
lawfull cause ys 
come vppon a man to 
haue a thinge whych 
an other hath, and he 
hath no action for the 
same, as title of mort­
maine, or to enter for 
breach of a condicion.
 
¶ Title of entrie.
TItle of entrie, is 
when one seised of 

 

lande in fee maketh a 
feoffement therof vp­
pon condicion, & the 
condicion is broken: 
Now after the condi­
cion thus broken, the 
feoffour hath title to 
enter into the land, & 
may so do at his plea­
sure, and by his entry 
the freeholde shal bee 
saide to be in him pre­
sently. And it is cal­
led title of entrie, be­
cause that hee cannot 
haue a writ of Ryght 
against his feoffee vp­
pon condicion, for hys 
right was out of him 
by the feffement, which 
cannot be reduced with­
out entrie, & the entrie 
must be for the breach 
of the condicion
 
¶ Tolle, or Tolne.
TOlle or Tolne, is 
most properlye a 
payment vsed in Ci­
ties, townes, markets 
& faires for goods and 

 

cattel brought thither 
to bee bought & solde. 
And is alwaies to bee 
paied by the buyer, & 
not by the seller, ex­
cept there be some cus­
tome otherwise. 
 
There are diuers o­
ther tolles, as Turne 
tolle, & that is where 
toll is paied for beasts 
that are dryuen to bee 
solde, although that 
they bee not solde in 
deede. 
 
Also Tolle trauers, 
that is where one clai­
meth to haue a halfe­
peny, or such like toll 
of euery beast that is 
driuen ouer his ground. 
 
Through tolle, is 
where a Towne pre­
scribes to haue tol for 
euery beast that goeth 
through their towne 
a certein: or for euery 
score or 100. a certein, 
which seemeth not to 
bee so vnreasonable a 
prescription or custome 
as some haue thought 

 

although it be through 
the Queenes hyghe 
way (as they call it,) 
where euery man may 
lawfully go, if that 
there be one thing for 
another, as if there be 
a bridge or such lyke 
commoditie prouyded 
at the costes & charges 
of the Towne, for the 
ease of trauaylers that
driue that way, where 
by theyr iourney ys 
either shortned or bet­
tered, why then may 
not tolle be lawfully 
and with good reason 
demaunded of them &c. 
But diuers Citizens & 
Townes men are free 
from paying tolle by 
graunt of the Queene 
or her auncestors, or 
do claime the same by 
prescription or cus­
tome. So also spiry­
tual persons & religi­
ous men (as they call 
them) were quit of pay­
ing tol for their goods 
& marchandises bought 

 

and sold, but now the 
Statute of king H. 
8. will that they shall 
not marchandise. But 
enquyre whether the 
intent of the statute be 
obserued among them 
at this day or not, 
some say it is not. 
 
Also tenants in aun­
cient demesne ought 
to be quite thorough 
the whole Realme of 
paying tolle, as appea­
reth before in the title 
Sokemans. And in al 
these cases where toll 
is demaunded where it 
ought not to be paied 
of them that should go, 
buy, & sell tolle free 
there the partie or par­
ties greued may haue 
a writ, De effendi quie­
tum de tolonio, against 
him or them that so 
demaunded tolle con­
trarie to the Queene 
or her progenitours 
graunt, or contra­
rie to custome or pre­
scription.

 

¶ Sheriffes tourne.
SHerifes tourne is a 
court of record in al 
things that pertaine 
to the tourn. And it is 
the queenes leete tho­
rough al the countye, 
and the sherif is iudg. 
And whosoeuer hath 
a leete, hath the same 
aucthority within the 
precinct, as the sherife 
hath within the tourne.
 
¶ Treasure found.
TReasure founde is 
when any money, 
gold, or siluer, plate, or 
bolion, is found in any 
place, & no man know­
eth to whom the pro­
perty is, then the pro­
perty therof belongeth 
to the queene, and that 
is called treasure tro­
ue, that is to say trea­
sure found. But if a­
myne of mettal be found 
in any ground that al­
way pertaineth to the 

 

Lorde of the soile, ex­
cept it bee a myne of 
golde, or siluer which 
shall bee to the queen 
in whose grounde so 
euer it be found.
 
¶ Viewe
VIewe is when a­
nye actyon real is 
brought and the te­
naunt knoweth not 
well what lande it is, 
that the demaundaunt 
asketh, then the tenant 
shal praye the viewe, 
that is to say, that he 
may se the land which 
hee claimeth. But if 
the tenant hath had 
the viewe in tone writ 
and after the writt is 
abated by misnaming 
of the towne, or by 
iointure, and after the 
demaundaunt brin­
geth an other writte 
against the tenaunt, 
then the tenant shall 

 

not haue the view in 
the second writ.
 
¶ Viscount.
VIscount is a ma­
gistrate, and offi­
cer, of grat authoryty 
whom wee commonly 
call (Sherife) or to 
speake more truelye 
(Shire reue) and 
was at the first called 
(Shiregereue) that 
is to say the keeper of 
 the Shire, or the 
reue or ruler of the 
shire, for (Gereue) be­
ing deriued of the sax­
on worde (Gereccan) 
to rule, was first cal­
led (Gerecfa) & then 
(Gerefa) which beto­
keneth a ruler. And 
hereof commeth (Por­
treue or rather Port­
greue) a name that in 
olde tyme was geuen 
to the head officer of a 
town, & signifieth the 
ruler of the town for the
(Port) comminge of the 

 

latine worde Portus, 
signifieth a port town 
and (Gereue) beinge 
deriued as is aforesaid 
signifieth a ruler, soe 
that portgereue or as we 
now shorter speake it 
(Portreue) is the ru­
ler of the towne. 
 
And thus was the 
heade Officer or Go­
uernour of the Citye 
of London long since 
(before they had the 
name of Maior or 
Baylifes) called, as 
it doth appeare in dy­
uers olde monuments 
But chiefelye in the 
Saxon Charter of 
Willyam Bastard the 
conqueror, which thus 
beginneth. Willyam 
the Kynge greeteth 
Willyam the bishope, 
and Godfreye the 
Portreue, and also 
the Citizens that in 
London be &c. 
 
So also they of 
Germany from whom
wee and our language 

 

together first came,) 
call among them one 
gouernor Burgreeue, 
and other Margreue, 
and an other Lands­
greue, with such like 
&c. 
 
Thus much is sayde 
onely to shew the right 
Etymon and antiqui­
tie of the woord (shi­
rife) to which Officer 
our common law hath 
alwayes accordinglie 
geeuen great trust and 
aucthoritie, as to be a 
special preseruer of the
peace. And therefore 
all obligations that 
he takes to the same 
end, are as Recogny­
sances in law. He also 
is a Iudge of Record 
when hee holdes the 
Leetes or Tournes, 
whych are Courts of 
recorde. 
 
Also hee hath the 
retourne of writtes, 
and impannellyng of 
Iuries, and such like 
&c.

 

¶ Voucher.
VOucher, is when 
a Pr&ecedil;cipe quod red­
dat of land is brought 
against a man, & an o­
ther ought to warrant 
the land to the tenant: 
then the tenant shall 
vouch him to warran­
tie, and thereupon he 
shal haue a writ called 
Summonias ad warran­
tizandum, & if the Shi­
rife returne that hee 
hath nothinge by the 
which he may be sum­
moned, then ther shal 
go forth a writ called 
Sequatur sub suo periculo, 
and when he commeth 
he shal plede with the 
demaundant, and if he 
come not, or if he come 
and cannot barre the 
demaundant, then the 
demaundant shall re­
couer the land against 
the tenant, & the te­
nant shall recouer as 
much lande in value 
against the vouchee, 

 

and thereupon he shal 
haue a writ called Ca­
pias ad valentiam against 
the vouche.
 
¶ Vses.
VSes of lande had 
beginning after the
 custome of proper­
tie began among men. 
As where one beeyng 
seised of landes in fee 
simple, made a feoffe­
ment to another with 
out any consideration, 
but onely meaninge 
that the other should 
bee seised to his vse, 
and that hee him selfe 
would take the com­
moditie and profits of 
the landes, & that the 
feoffee should haue the 
possession and frank­
tenement thereof to the
same vse &c. Now af­
ter this vpon good con­
siderations, & to auoid 
diuers mischiefes and 
inconueniences, was 
the statute of Anno 27. 

 

H. 8 cap. 10. prouided, 
which vniteth the vse 
& possession together, 
so that who hath the 
vse of lande, the same 
hath the possession ther­
of. by vertue of that 
estatute.
 
¶ Vsurie.
VSurie, is a gayne 
of any thing aboue 
the principal, or that 
which was lent, exac­
ted onely in conside­
ration of the loane, 
whether it be of corn, 
meat, apparel, wares, 
or such like, as of 
money. And here 
much myght be saied, 
and many cases might 
bee putt concernynge 
Vsurie, whiche of 
purpose I omytte, 
onely I wyshe, that 
they who accompte 
themselues religious & 
good christians, would 
not deceiue themselues 

 

by colour of the sta­
tute of vsurie, because 
it sayeth that it shall 
not be lawful for any 
to take aboue x. ii. in 
the C. li. for a yere &c. 
whereby they gather 
(although falsly) that 
they may therefore 
take x. li. for the loane 
of an C. li. with a good 
conscience, because the 
Statute doth after a 
sort dispence withal, 
(for that it doth not 
punish such taking,) 
which thing it cannot 
do with the lawes & 
ordinances of God, for 
God will haue his de­
crees to be kept inuio­
lable, who sayth, lende 
looking for nothynge 
thereby &c. By which 
woordes is excluded, 
eyther the taking of 
x. li. v. li. yea, or one 
penny aboue the prin­
cipall. But rather let 
such think, that that sta­
tute was made vppon 
like cause, that moued 

 

Moyses to gyue a 
bill of dyuorce to the 
Isralites, as name­
lye to auoyde a grea­
ter mischiefe, and for 
the hardnesse of their 
hartes.
 
¶ Vtlawrie.
VTlawry is when an 
exigent goeth forth 
against any man, & pro­
clamation made at v. 
counties, then at the v. 
countye if the def. ap­
pere not, the coroner 
shal giue iudgement that
he shalbe out of the pro­
tection of the Queene, 
& out of the aide of the 
lawe, and by such an 
vtlary in actions per­
sonals, the party out­
lawed shall forfayt al 
his goodes and cattels 
to the Queene. And by 
an vtlary in felony, hee 
shall forfait aswel all 
his landes, and tene­
ments that he hath in 
fee simple, or for terme 

 

of his life: as his 
good & cattals. And 
though a man be out­
lawed, yet if any er­
ror or discontinuance 
be in the suit of the proces 
the party thereof shal 
haue aduantage, & for 
such cause the vtlary 
shalbe reuersed & ad­
nulled. Or if the partye 
defendant be ouer the 
sea at the time of the vtla­
ry pronounced that is 
a good cause of the re­
uersal of the vtlary. 
 
If an exigent be awar­
ded against a man in 
one county where hee 
dwelleth not yet an 
exigent with proclamation
shal go forth to the coun­
ty where he dwelleth: 
or els if he be thervpon
vtlawed, the vtlary may 
be reuersed as it appe­
reth by the statute made 
the 4 yere of King H. 
8. And if a man be out 
lawed in an action per­
sonal at the suit of an o­
ther, and after he pur­

 

chase his charter of 
pardon of the Queen, 
such charter shal ne­
uer be allowed, til hee 
hath sued a writte of 
Scire facias to warne 
the partye plaintife, 
and if he appeare, then 
the defendant shal an­
swere him, and barre 
him of his action, or 
els make agreement 
with him.
 
¶ Waife.
WAyfe is when a 
theefe hath felo­
niously stolne goodes, 
and beinge neerelye 
followed with hue, 
and crye, or els ouer­
charged with the bur­
den or trouble of the 
goodes, for his ease 
sake and more speedye 
trauailinge, without 
hue and cry, flieth a­
way and leaueth the 
goods or any part of 
them behind him, then 
the queenes officer or 

 

the Reeue, or Bailife 
to the Lord of the ma­
nour (within whose 
Iurisdiction or circuit 
they were left) that 
by prescriptyon, or 
graunt from the Queene 
hath the fraunchise of 
waife, may seyse the 
goodes so wayued to 
their lordes vse, who 
may keepe them as his 
owne proper goods: 
except that the owner 
come with fresh suite 
after the felon, & sue 
an appeale, or giue in 
euidence against him 
at his arrainement vpon
the indictment, and be 
attainted thereof &c. 
In which cases the first 
owner shall haue res­
titution of his goodes 
so stollen and way­
ued. 
 
But although as 
hath byn sayd wayfe 
is properly of goodes 
stollen, yet wayfe 
may bee also the goods 
that are not stolne. 

 

As if a man bee pur­
sued wyth hue, and 
crye, as a felon, and 
hee flyeth, and leaueth 
his owne goodes &c. 
these shalbe taken as 
good wayued, & for­
fait as if they had bin 
stolne.
 
¶ Waiue.
WAiue is a woman
that is autlawed, 
& she is called waiue, 
as left out or forsaken 
of the law, and not an 
vtlawe as a man is. 
For women are not 
sworne in leetes to the 
lawe, as menn are, 
whoe therefore are 
within the law, where­
as women are not, 
and for that cause 
they cannot bee sayd 
out of the lawe in so 
much as they neuer 
were within it. But a 
man is called vtlawe, 
beecause that hee was 

 

once sworne to the law: 
& now for contempt he 
is put out of the law, 
& is called vtlawe, as 
one shoulde say without 
benefite of the law.
 
¶ Warwite.
WArwite (or ward 
wite as some co­
pies haue it) that is 
to bee quite of giuing 
of money for keeping 
of watches.
 
¶ Wrecke.
WRecke or varech
as the Normans 
from whom it came 
call it, is where a ship 
is perished on the sea, 
and no man escapeth 
a liue out of the same, 
and the shippe, or part 
of the ship so perished, 
or the goods of the ship 
come to the lande of a­
ny Lorde, the Lorde 
shall haue that as a 
wreck of the sea, but if a 

 

man, or a dogg, or cat, 
escape a liue, so that the
partye to whome the 
goods belong come with­
in a yere and a day and 
proue the goods to bee 
his, he shal haue them a 
gaine, by prouision of 
the statute of West. that
I. cap. 4. made in king 
Ed. I. daies, who there 
in followed the decree 
of Henry the first, be­
fore whose daies, if a 
shippe had ben cast on 
shore, torne with tem­
pest, and were not re­
paired by such as es­
caped a lyue within a 
certeyne tyme, that 
then this was taken 
for wrecke.

 

FINIS. 



 



¶ Seruice de chiualer.
TO holde by 
knightes ser­
uice, is to holde 
by homage, fe­
alty, & escuage, 
and it draweth to it 
warde, mariage, & re­
liefe, and knowe thou 
that knightes seruice 
is seruice of landes or 
tenementes to beare 
armes in warre in the 
defence of the Realme, 
& it oweth warde in the 
defence of the Realme, 
& it oweth warde and 
mariage by reason that 
none is able nor of 
power, nor may haue 
knowledge to beare 
armes, before that he be of 
the age of 21. yeres. 
And for so much that the 
lord shal not leese that 
that of right he ought 
to haue, & that the power 
of the realme, nothing 
be made weake. The 
law wil because of his 
tender age, that the 
Lord him shal haue in 
his warde till the full 

 

age of him, that is to 
say xxj. yeres.
 
¶ Graunde serieantie.
TO hold by graund 
serieanty is as if a 
man hold certein lands 
or tenementes of the 
king to go with him 
in his host, or to beare 
his banner with him 
in his warres, or to 
leade his host, or such 
like, and thereto bee­
longeth warde mary­
age and relyefe, as it 
appeareth in the trea­
tise of wards and re­
liefes in the statute made 
the 28. of Edwarde 
the I.
 
¶ Petit Serieantie.
TO holde by petit 
serieantie is as if a 
man hold of the kinge 
landes or tenementes, 
yelding to him a knife, 
a buckler, an Arrowe, 
a Bow without stringe, 

 

or other like seruice at 
the will of the first 
feoffour, and there be­
longeth not warde 
maryage ne relyefe. 
And marke well that 
a man may not holde 
by graunde nor petit 
serieantie, but of the 
King.
 
¶ Escuage.
To hold by escuage is 
by knightes seruice, & 
there belongeth ward, 
mariage, and reliefe. 
And marke well that 
a man may not holde 
by escuage, but that 
hee holde by homage, 
for that escuage of 
common ryght dra­
weth to him homage, 
as it was Iudged 
Termino H. 21. E. 
3. cap. 42. fol. 52. 
Auowrye 115. And 
note well, that es­
cuage is a certeyne 
summe of money, and 

 

it ought to bee leuyed 
by the Lord of his te­
nant after the quanti­
tie of his tenure, when 
escuage runneth by al 
Englande. And it is 
ordeined by al the coun­
sell of England how 
much euery tenaunt 
shal geue to his Lord, 
and that is properlye 
for to maintayne the 
warres betwene Eng­
land, & them of Scot­
lande or of Wales, 
and not beetwene o­
ther landes, for that, 
that those foresayd lands 
should be of ryght be­
longinge to the Re­
alme of England.
 
¶ Homage auncestrel.
TO holde by homage 
auncestrel is where 
I or my auncestours 
haue holden of you & of 
your auncestors from 
time out of mind wher 
of no minde runneth, 

 

by homage, fealty, and 
certaine rent. And it 
is not to holde by 
knightes seruice, and 
there belongeth not 
ward, mariage, nor 
reliefe. And note well 
that homage may bee 
said in ij. maners, that is 
to say, homage ances­
trel, & homage de fait
Homage auncestrel is 
where you or your an­
cestors haue holden of 
me and mine aunces­
tors during the time 
of mans remembrance, 
by homage, fealty, and 
rent. Homage de fait is 
where I enfeffe your 
selfe, to hold of mee by 
homage and rent, and 
in so much that this 
homage beginneth by 
my deede, it is called 
homage de fait. 
 
And note wel that 
Homage auncestrell 
draweth to him vou­
cher, that is to say, war­
ranty of auncestors, but 
not homage de fait.

 

¶ Curtesy of England.
TO hold by the cur­
tesy of Englande 
is there where a man 
taketh a wife inheri­
trix, & they haue issue 
a sonne or daughter, & 
the wife dieth, whe­
ther the issue be deade 
or aliue, the husband shal 
hold this land for term 
of his life by the cur­
tesy of England, & by 
the law. And in this 
case the fee & the right 
remaineth in the person 
of him of whom he hol­
deth: and for that, this 
tenant may not alyen 
in fee, nor for terme of 
anothers life, & if he do 
it is lawful to him in the
reuersion to enter.
 
¶ Fee simple.
TO hold in fee sim­
ple is to hold to a­
ny man or woman, to 
him & to his heirs and 
his assignes for euer.

 

¶ Franke tenure.
TO hold in free hold 
is to hold for terme 
of his owne lyfe, or 
for terme of an other 
mans life. And in this 
case the fee & the right 
remaineth in the per­
son of him, of whome 
he holdeth. And for that
this tenaunt may not 
alien in fee nor for 
terme of life: And if he 
do, it is well lawfull 
to him in whom the 
fee & the right abideth 
to enter.
 
¶ Dower.
TO hold in dower is 
where a man inhe­
rite taketh a wife and 
dieth, the heire shal en­
ter, & endow the wyfe 
of the third part of al 
that that was to her hus­
band in his life, in fee 
simple or fee taile, and 
shee shall holde these 
landes for terme of 

 

her lyfe as her free 
holde.
 
¶ Terme dans.
TO hold for terme of 
yeares is not but 
chattel in effect, for no 
action is maintenable 
against the termour, 
for the recouering of 
the freehold for no free 
hold is in him. A leas 
for terme of yeares is 
a chattel reall, and 
the other chattel per­
sonall, and all goods 
whych are remoua­
ble are chattelles per­
sonals.
 
¶ Mortgage.
TO hold in morgage 
is to hold for a cer­
taine terme vpon con­
dition, that if the les­
sor pay so much mony 
at such a day, that hee 
may enter, and if not, 
that the other shal haue 
a fee simple or fee taile, 
or free holde. And in 

 

euery case where lands 
or tenements be geuen 
to a man for a certeine 
terme vpon condition 
of the part of the lessor 
for to make the lessee 
to haue more long time 
or terme, if the other do 
not as the condition 
is, the landes and te­
nementes vntyll the 
daye that the con­
dicyon shoulde bee 
done, bee holden in 
morgage, as in a dead 
gage. 
 
And note well that 
if land be let to a man 
in morgage in fee sim­
ple or in fee taile vpon 
condition, that if the 
first lessor, as is before 
said, pay so much mo­
ney at such a day that 
he may enter, & if not, 
that the lessee haue the 
same estate in the lands, 
that the lessour dyd 
him graunt at the be­
ginninge. And if be­
fore the day assigned, 
the lessee bee disseised, 

 

he shall haue assise of 
nouel disseisin. And in 
case that if the lessee 
take a wife & dye sey­
sed before the day as­
signed, the woman shall 
be endowed. 
 
And note well, that 
if the lessor after the 
death of the lessee pay 
not the money, at the 
day assigned, then the 
woman shall hold her 
dower, and the issue 
his heritage. And in 
case the lessour at the 
day assigned pay the 
money to the heire o f 
the lessee, then he may 
put out the woman & 
the heire also of al the 
land first let. And if a 
man geeue lands to an 
other in the taile, yel­
ding to him a certeine 
rent by the yere, & one 
enter for default of 
payment, the donee ta­
keth a wife and dyeth 
seised, the woman shal 
be endowed. And in 
case that after the rent 

 

be behind, the donour 
may enter & put out 
the woman & the heire 
also. And note well, 
that if landes be let to 
a man in Morgage in 
fee vpon condicion, the 
lessee doth alien, the 
lessour shal bee char­
ged to pay the mo­
ney to the alienee, and 
not to the feoffee, as 
it is saide.
 
¶ Burgage.

 

TO holde in Bur­
gage, is to holde as 
if the Burgeis holde 
of the king, or of ano­
ther Lord lands or te­
nements, yelding to 
him a certeine rent by 
the yeare, or els there 
where another man 
then burge is holdeth 
of any Lord landes or 
tenements in burgage, 
yelding to him a cer­
tein rent by yeare.
 
¶ Socage.
TO hold in Socage 
is to holde of any 
Lord landes or tene­
ments, yelding to him 
a certeine rent by the 
yere for al maner ser­
uices. And note wel, 
that to holde by So­
cage is not to holde by 
knightes seruice, nor 
there belongeth ward, 
mariage, nor relyefe, 
but they shall double 
once their rent after the
death of their aunces­
tors according to that 
that they be wont to 
pay to their lord. And 
they shall not be ouer 
measure greued, as it 
appeareth in the treatise 
of wardes & reliefes. 
And note wel, that So­
cage may be said in iij. 
maners, that is to say, 
socage in free tenure, 
Socage in auncient 
tenure, and Socage in 
base tenure. Socage 
in free tenure is to hold 
frely by certein rent for 
all maner of seruices, 

 

as is before said, and 
of that the next kyns 
bodie shall haue the 
warde to whom the 
heritage may not dis­
cend, til the age of xiiij 
yeares, that is to say, 
if the heritage come 
by the part of the father 
they of the part of the 
mother shall haue the 
ward, & contrarywise 
 
And note wel that if 
the gardein in So­
cage do make wast, he 
shall not be impeched 
of wast, but he shall 
yelde accompt to the 
heire when he shal come 
to his full age of xxj. 
yeares. And looke the 
statute of Marlebridge 
ca. 17. for this matter. 
Socage in auncient te­
nure is that where the 
people in auncient de­
mesne helde, whych 
vse no other wryt to 
haue then the writ of 
right close, which shal 
be determined accor­
ding to the custome of 

 

the manor, & the Mon­
strauerunt for to dys­
charge them when their 
Lord distrayneth them
for to do other seruice 
that they ought not to do 
And this writ of Mon­
strauerunt ought to bee 
brought agaynst the 
Lord, & those tenants 
hold al by one certain 
seruice, & these be free 
tenaunts of auncient 
demesne. 
 
Socage in base te­
nure is where a man 
holdeth in auncyent 
demesne, that may not 
haue the Monstrauerunt, 
and for that it is cal­
led the base Tenure.
 
¶ Fee ferme.
TO hold in fee ferme 
is to hold in fee sim­
ple, yelding to the Lord 
the value, or at the least 
the fourth part by the 
yeare, & he ought to do 
no other thing, but as 
it is conteined in the 
feffement, and he that 

 

holdeth in fee ferme 
ought to do fealtie & 
not reliefe.
 
¶ Franke fee.
TO holde in franke 
fee, is to hold in fee 
simple lands pledable 
at the common law.
 
¶ Base fee.
TO hold in fee base, 
is to holde at the 
will of the Lord.
 
¶ Villenage.
TO hold in pure vil­
lenage, is to doe all 
that, that the Lorde 
wil him commaund. 
 
The diffinition of 
villenage is villein of 
bloud, and of tenure. 
And it is he of whom 
the Lord taketh redemp­
tion to marie his dau­
ghter, & to make hym 
free, & it is he whom the
Lord may put out of 

 

his landes or tene­
mentes at his will, & 
also of all his goods & 
cattel. And note wel, 
that a sokeman is no 
pure villein, nor a vil­
lein oweth not ward, 
mariage, nor reliefe, 
nor to do any other 
seruices reall. And 
note well, that the te­
nure in villenage shal 
make no free man vil­
lein, if it be not conti­
nued sith time out of 
mind, nor villein land 
shal make no free man 
villein, nor free lande 
shal make no villeine 
free, except that the tenant 
haue continued free sith 
the time of no minde, 
but a villein shal make 
free land villein by sei­
sin or claime of the lord. 
And note wel, that if 
a villein purchase cer­
teine lande, and take a 
wife & alyen, and dy­
eth before the clayme 
or seisin of the lord, the
wife shalbe endowed, 

 

And note wel, that in 
case that the lord bringe 
a Precipe quod reddat a­
gainst the alien which 
voucheth to warrant 
the issue of the villein 
which is villein to the
lord, he shal haue the 
voucher, & by protes­
tation the lorde may 
say that (notwithstanding 
that he pled with his 
villein) yet his villein 
shal not be enfranchi­
sed. And note wel that
a bastard shall neuer 
be iudged villeine, but 
by knowledg in court 
of recorde. And note 
well that if det be due 
by a Lorde to a free 
man, and hee maketh 
two men his execu­
tours the which bee 
villeines to the saide 
Lorde and dyeth, the 
villeines shal haue an 
actyon of det against 
their Lorde not with­
standinge that hee 
plead with them. And 
if he make protestation

 

they shal not be for so 
much enfranchised, for 
that that they be to 
recouer the dett afore 
said to the vse of an o­
ther person that is to 
say to the vse of their 
testatour, and not to 
their owne vse. And 
if the tenant in dower 
haue a villeine which 
purchaseth certaine 
lande in fee, and after 
the tenaunt in dower 
entreth, she shal haue 
the land to her an to 
her heires for euer­
more, & the same lawe 
is of tenant for terme 
of yeares of a villein. 
 
And note wel that 
the lord may robb his 
villein, bete & chastice 
at his wil, saue onely 
that he may not maim 
him for then he shall 
haue appel of maime a­
gainst him. 
 
And note wel, that 
a villein may haue iij. 
actions against his lord 
that is to say, appeale 

 

of deth of his ancestor, 
appel of rape done to 
his wife, and appel of 
maime. And note wel 
if ij. parceners bringe 
a writ of niefe, and one 
of them be nonsuit, the 
nonsuit of him shal be 
iudged the nonsuit of 
them both, so that if the
nonsuit be after appea­
rance, they shal be put 
out from that actyon 
for euer, for the lawe 
is such in fauour of 
lybertye. And note 
wel, if two haue a vil­
leine in common, and 
one of them make to 
him a manumission, he 
shal not be made free 
against both, And note 
well, that in a writ de 
Natiuo habendo, it bee­
houeth that the lorde 
shew how he commeth 
priuy of the bloode of 
the villeine of whom 
he is lord &c. And if he 
nor none of his aun­
cestours were not 
seised of none of his 

 

blood, he shal not winn 
by his action, if the 
villeine haue not kno­
wledged in court of 
record him selfe to bee 
his villein. And note 
wel that in a writt of 
Niefe may not be put 
more Niefes then two 
and this was first 
brought in in the ha­
tred of bondage. But 
in a writt de libertate 
probanda, may be put 
as many niefes as the 
plaintife wil. 
 
And note wel that 
if the villein of a lord be 
in auncien demesne of 
the king, or other town 
priuiledged, within a 
yeare & a day, the lord 
may seise him, & if hee 
dwel in the same towne 
or other place franchi­
sed by a yere & a daye 
without seisin of the 
lord, he hath no pow­
er to seise him after, if 
he go not in estrey out 
of the aforesaid fraunchis.
 
¶ Taile. 


 

TO hold in the taile 
is where a manne 
holdeth certain lands 
or tenements to hym 
& to his heires of hys 
bodie begotten. And 
note wel, that if the land 
be geeuen to a man & to 
his heires male, he hath 
fee simple, & that were 
adiudged in the Par­
liament of our lord the 
king. But where lands 
or tenements be geeuen 
to a man & to his heires 
males of his bodie be­
gotten, then hee hath 
fee taile, & the issue fe­
male shal not be enhe­
ritable, as it appea­
reth the xiiij. yeare of 
Ed. the iij. in assise.
 
¶ Taile after possibilitie.
TO hold in the taile 
after possibilitie of 
issue extinct, is where 
land is geeuen to a man
& to his wife, & to the 
heirz of their ij bodies 

 

ingendred, and one of 
them ouerlyueth the 
other wythout issue 
betwene them begot­
ten, he shall holde the 
land for terme of hys 
owne life, as tenant in 
the taile after possibi­
litie of issue extinct. 
And notwithstanding 
that hee do wast, hee 
shal neuer bee impea­
ched of that waste. 
And note that if he a­
lien, he in the reuersion 
shall not haue a writ 
of entrie in consimili
casu. But he may en­
ter, & his entre is law­
full, per Rob. Thorpe 
chiefe Iustice.
 
¶ Free Mariage.
TO holde in frank­
mariage, is to hold 
in the second taile ly­
mitted in the statute 
of Westminst. ij. cap. I 
And the feoffor shall 
acquite the feoffee of 
all maner of seruices 

 

vntil the 4. degree bee 
past, & the feffor shal do 
al the seruice & suites 
during the said terme. 
And after the heires 
of the feoffee shal do it, 
for that that the pri­
uitie of bloud is past. 
And if he be distrained 
for seruice, he shal haue 
a writt of Mesne a­
gainst him supposinge 
that hee held the lands 
of him, but hee shall 
not haue the fore­
iudgement if it bee not 
in aduauntage of his 
issues. 
 
And note wel, that 
after the fowerth de­
gree bee past, he shalbe 
attendant of as much 
seruice to the donour, 
as the donor is atten­
dant to the Lorde pa­
ramount. And if hee do 
felony for which hee 
is attaint, the kinge 
shal haue his lands for 
terme of his lyfe na­
turall. And after hys 
death, his issue shal in­

 

herite, as by force of 
the taile. And in this 
case, none shall haue 
his landes by way of 
escheate, no more then 
in any other taile. And 
in case that the tenant 
die without heire of 
his body begotten, the 
lande shall reuert to 
the donor as it should 
in the common tayle. 
And if a man let hys 
lande to another in 
 franke mariage yel­
dinge to him a cer­
tayne rent by yeare, 
hee shal hold this land 
in the common tayle, 
and not in frankenma­
riage for by the rent 
reserued, these words 
(in liberum maritagium) 
bee al vtterly voyd, so 
that the tenure shalbe 
intended after the te­
nure in the common 
taile. 
 
And note well that 
the gift in franke ma­
riage hath a condicion 
annexed to it, notwith­

 

standing that it be not 
openly declared in the 
deede of the gift, as it 
appeareth by the sta­
tute of Westminst. ij. 
cap. I. De donis condi­
cionalibus. 
 
And note well that 
a man shall not geeue 
lands nor tenementes 
in frankmariage, but 
where the woman is 
priuie of bloud to the 
donor, for els the man 
nor the woman shall 
haue no other estate 
by the feoffement but 
for terme of lyfe.
 
¶ Free almes.
TO holde in franke 
almoigne is to hold 
landes or tenementes 
for to serue God and 
holy church to endow 
without doing any o­
ther maner of seruice. 
And note wel, that in 
this case the donor is 
mesne, & ought to ac­
quit him freely against 

 

the chiefe Lorde, & also 
they that hold in frank 
almoigne shal doe no 
fealtie, but they that 
holde in franke ma­
riage, shal do fealtie.
 
¶ Elegit.
TO holde by Elegit 
is where a man hath 
recouered debt or dam­
mage by a writte a­
gainst another or by 
confession or in other 
maner, he shall haue 
within the yeare a­
gainst him a writ Iu­
diciall called Elegyt 
to haue execution of 
the halfe of al his lands 
and cattelles, (except 
Oxen and beastes of 
the plowe) tyll the 
debt or dammages bee 
vtterly leuied or paied 
to him, & during the 
terme he is tenaunt by 
Elegit. And note wel 
if he be put out with­
in the terme hee shall 
haue assise of nouell 

 

disseisin, and after a re­
disseisin if neede be, and 
this is geuen by the sta­
tute of Westminster: 
cap. 18. & also by the 
equity of the same sta­
tute, he that hath his 
estate if hee be put out 
shal haue assise and a 
redisseisin if neede bee, 
and also if hee make 
his executors and die, 
and his executors en­
ter and after bee put 
out, they shall haue by 
the equity of the same 
statute such action as 
hee him selfe before­
sayde, but if hee bee 
put out, and after 
make his executours 
and dye, his executors 
may enter, and if they 
bee stopped of their 
entre, they shall haue 
a writte of trespasse 
vppon their matter 
and case. 
 
And note wel if hee 
do wast in al the lande 
or parcel, the other shal 
haue against him im­

 

mediately a writ Iu­
diciall out of the first 
recorde called a veni­
re facias ad computan­
dum, by which it shal 
bee inquired if he haue 
leuyed all the money, 
or parcell, and if hee 
haue not leuyed the 
money, then it shalbee 
inquired to how much 
the wast amounteth, 
and if the waste a­
mount but to parcel, 
then as much of the 
money, as the wast 
amounteth shalbee a­
bridged of the fore­
sayde money whych 
was to be leuied. But 
if hee haue oone more 
wast then the foresaid 
summe of mony which 
was to bee leuyed a­
mounteth, the other 
shall be discharged by 
and by all the sayd 
money, and shall re­
couer the lande, and 
for the superfluity of 
the wast made aboue 
that that amounteth 

 

to the saide summe, he 
shall recouer hys da­
mages single, and the 
same lawe is of hys 
executours, and also 
of him that hath his 
estate. And note that 
if hee alyen in fee, for 
terme of lyfe, or in 
taile all or parcell of 
the land which he hol­
deth by Elegit, if the 
alienation be made with­
in the terme or after, 
hee which hath right 
shall haue against him 
one assise of nouel dis­
seisin. And they both 
must be put in the as­
sise the alyenour & the 
alyenee, and notwith­
standinge that the a­
lienor by presently, yet 
he which hath right 
shal haue an assise a­
gainst the alienee alone 
as if the alienor had ben 
a plain tenant for term 
of yeres, & that is by 
the equity of the statute 
of w. 2. ca. 25. for that 

 

that he hath not but a 
chattel in effect, and that
same law is of his ex­
ecutours and of him 
which hath his estate 
as is aforesaid. 
 
And note wel that 
in an Elegit, if the 
sherife returne that he 
had nothinge the daye 
of the reconizance made 
but that he purchased 
lands after the time, 
then the party plain­
tife shal haue a newe 
writte to haue execu­
tion thereof, the same 
lawe is of a statute 
marchant. And note 
wel that after a fyery 
facyas a man may haue 
the Elegit, but not 
contrarie wise, for so 
much that the elegit 
is of more higher na­
ture then the fiery fa­
cias. And note wel that
if a man recouer by a 
writt of debt and su­
eth a fiery facyas, and 
the sherife return that 
the partye hath no­

 

thing whereof he may 
make gree with the par­
ty, then the plaintife shal 
haue a capias sicut ali­
as, & a pluries, and if 
the sherife returne at 
the capias mitto vobis 
corpus, & he haue no­
thing where of he may 
make gree to the partye, 
he shall be sent to the 
prison of the Fleete. & 
there shal abide till he 
haue made agreement 
with the party, & if the she­
rife returne non est in­
uentus then there shall 
go forth an exigent a­
gainst him. And note 
wel that in a writ of debt 
brought against a per­
son of holy Church, 
which hath nothinge 
of lay fee, & the sherife 
returneth, that hee hath 
nought by which hee 
may be summoned, then
shal the plaintife sue a 
writ to the Bishoppe 
that he make his clerk 
to come, and the Bi­
shop shall make him to 

 

come by sequestration 
of the Church. And 
note well, that if a man
bring a writ of debte 
& recouer, & make hys 
executors & dieth, they 
shall haue execution 
notwithstanding that 
it be within the yeare 
by a fieri facias.
 
¶ Statute merchant.
TO holde by Sta­
tute merchaunt, is 
where a man knowle­
geth to paye certayne 
money to another at a 
certaine day before the 
maior, bailife, or other 
warden of any towne 
that hath power to make 
execution of the same 
statute, & if the obligee 
pay not the debt at the 
day, & nothing of hys 
goods, landes, or tene­
mentes may be founde 
within the warde of 
the maior or warden 
beforesaide, but in o­
ther places wythout, 

 

then the recognisee shall 
sue the recognisaunce 
and obligation with 
a certification to the 
Chauncery vnder the 
kinges seale, and hee 
shall haue out of the 
chauncery a capias to 
the sherife of the coun­
tie where he is to take 
him and to put him in 
prison, if hee bee not a 
clarke, tyll hee haue 
made greement of the 
debt. And one quar­
ter of the yeare after 
that, that hee shall bee 
taken, hee shall haue 
his lande delyuered 
to himselfe to make 
gree to the partye of 
the debt, and hee may 
sel it while hee is in 
prison, and his sale 
shalbee good and law­
full. And if he doo not 
gree within a quarter of a 
yere, or if it be retur­
ned that be not founde, 
then the reconisee may 
haue a writ of the chaun­
cery which is called 

 

Extendi facias, directe to 
al sherifes, where hee 
hath landes, to extend 
his landes and goods, 
& to deliuer the goods 
to him, and to seyse 
him in his landes, to 
holde them to him and 
to his heires and his 
assignes, till that the 
debtes bee leuyed or 
payed, & for that time 
he is tenaunt by sta­
tute merchaunt. And 
note well, that in a 
statute merchaunt the 
reconisee shal haue ex­
ecution of al the lands 
which the reconisour 
had the day of the re­
cognisaunce made, and 
any time after by force 
of the same statute. 
 
And note well, that 
when any wast or des­
truction is made by 
the reconisee, his exe­
cutors, or by him that 
hath estate, the reco­
nisour or hys execu­
tours shall haue the 
same law as is before­

 

saide of the tenant by 
Elegit. 
 
And note wel, if the 
tenaunt by statute 
marchant holde ouer 
his terme, hee that 
hath right maye sue 
against him a Venire 
facias ad computandum
or els enter by & by as 
vpon tenat by Elegit.
 
¶ Rent seruice
There be three ma­
ners of rentes, that 
is to saye, Rent ser­
uice Rent charge, and 
Rent secke. Rent ser­
uice is, where a man 
holdeth of an other 
by Fealtye, and for 
to do suit to his court 
and yeldinge to him 
a certaine rent by the 
yeare for al manner 
of seruices. 
 
And note wel that 
if the Lorde bee seised 
of the seruice and rent 
beforesaid, and they be 
behinde, and hee dis­
traine, and the tenant 
rescueth the distresse 

 

hee may haue assise, or 
a writte of rescous, 
but it is more necessa­
rye for him to haue 
assise then a writt of 
rescous, for that by 
assise he shal recouer 
his rent and his da­
mages, but by a writt 
of rescous he shal not 
recouer but the thing 
and the dammages. 
 
And note wel, that 
if the lorde be not sei­
sed of the rent and 
seruice and they be be­
hinde, and he distreine 
for them, and the te­
nant take againe the 
distresse, he shall not 
haue assise, but a writ 
of rescous, and shall 
not neede to shewe 
hys right. 
 
And note well that 
if the Lorde distreyne 
hys tenaunt in socage 
for Knightes seruice 
whiche is not deny­
ed hym, and auowe 
for the same seruice 
in courte of Recorde 

 

he shalbe charged by 
the same seruyce by 
Finch. term Hillarij Anno
xlvj. 
 
And note wel that if 
the lord may not finde 
a distresse by two yere, 
he shall haue against the
tenaunt a writ of Ces­
sauit per biennium as it 
appeareth by the sta­
tute of West. 2. ca. 21. 
And if the tenant die 
in the meane time and 
his issue enter, the lord 
shall haue against the 
issue a writt of entre 
vpon the Cessauit, or 
if the tenant alien, the 
lord shall haue against 
the alienne the foresaid 
writ. But if the Lord 
haue issue and die, and 
the tenaunt bee in ar­
rerages of the said rent 
and seruice in the time 
of the father of the is­
sue, & not in the time 
of the issue, he may not 
distrain for the arerages 
in the time of his father, 

 

and he shall haue none 
other recouery against 
the tenaunt or any o­
ther, for that that such 
aduantage is geuen by 
the law to the tenant. 
And note wel that rent 
seruice is that to the 
which belongeth feal­
tie, but to rent charge 
and rent secke belon­
geth not fealtie, but 
it belongeth to rent 
seruyce of common 
right.
 
¶ Rent charge.
Rent charge is where 
a man graunteth cer­
taine rent goinge out 
of his landes or tene­
mentes to another in 
fee simple, or in fee 
taile, or for terme of 
life by deede vpon con­
dition, that at what 
time the rent bee bee­
hinde, it shall be well 
and lawful to the graun­
tee to his heires or as­
signes to distrayne in 

 

the same landes or te­
nements. And note 
well, that if the rent 
bee behinde, it is well 
lawfull to the graun­
tee at his election to 
haue a writ of Annu­
itie, or els he may dis­
train, & if the distres bee 
taken against his wil 
from him, and he was 
neuer seised before, hee 
hath no recouery but 
by writ of Rescous, 
for the distres first ta­
ken geueth not to him 
seisin, onely if he happ 
the rent before, for if 
he were seised of the rent 
before, & after the rent 
be behind, & he distrain, 
& rescous to him bee 
made, he shal haue ass. 
or a writ of rescous, 
 
And note well, that 
in euerie Assise of 
rent charge and annu­
all rent, or in a writ 
of Annuitie, it bee­
houeth to hym that 
bringeth the writt to 

 

shewe foorth an espe­
cyaltye, or els hee 
shall not maynetayne 
the Assise, but in a 
Mortdauncestour or 
Forme done in the dis­
cender or other writs 
(in the which title 
is geeuen or compri­
sed) brought of rent 
charge, or annuell 
Rente, it needeth 
not to shewe especy­
altye. 
 
And note well that 
if a man graunt a rent 
charge to an other, & 
the grauntee purchase 
the halfe of the lande 
whereof the rent is 
going out, al the rent is 
extinct, and if the gran­
tee release to the gran­
tour parcell of the 
rent, yet al the rent is 
not extincte. 
 
But in rent seruice 
the law is otherwise, 
for notwithstandinge 
that the Lorde hath 
purchased the halfe of 
the lande whereof the 

 

rent is going out, yet 
the rent is not extinct 
but for the halfe, & the 
cause of the diuersitie 
is, that rent seruice 
may be seuered to one 
porcion, but not rent 
charge. 
 
And note well, that 
if rent charge be gran­
ted to two iointly, & 
the one release, yet the 
other shall haue the 
halfe of the rent. And 
also if one purchase the
halfe of the land where­
of the rent is goinge 
out, the other shall 
haue the half of the rent 
of his compainion: & 
if the disseisor charge the
land to straunger, & the 
disseisie bring as assise 
& recouer, the charge 
is defeated. But if hee 
that hath right charge the
land, & a stranger faine 
a false action against 
him, and recouer by 
defaut. the charge a­
bydeth. And note 
well, that in case that 

 

purpartie be betwene 
ij. parceners, and more 
land be allotted to one 
then to the other, and 
shee that hath more of 
the land, chargeth her 
land to the other, and 
she happeth the rent, 
she shal maintein As­
sise without especial­
tie. And if the grauntee 
haue in fee simple, or in 
fee taile, & hath issue & 
dyeth, if the issue bring 
a Formedon, or assise 
of Mortdauncester, he 
shall neuer be charged 
to shew an especialty.
 
¶ Rent secke.
REnt seck, is where 
a man holdeth of me 
by homage, fealtie, & 
other seruice, yelding 
to me a certeine rent 
by the yeare, and I 
graunt this rent to an 
other, reseruing to me 
the seruice. 
 
And note well, that 
in rent seck, if a man be 

 

seised of the rent, and 
the rent be behind, hee 
may not distreine, but 
he shall haue assise of 
nouel disseisine. 
 
And note wel that if 
rent seck be granted to 
man and to his heirs 
and the rent bee bee­
hinde, and the graun­
tour dye, the heire 
may not distrein, nor 
shall recouer the ar­
rereges of the tyme 
of his father, as it 
is beefore saide of rent 
seruice. 
 
And in the same 
manner it is to saye 
of Rent charge, or 
annuell rent. But 
in all these rentes 
beefore saide the heire 
maye haue for the 
arrerages in his own 
tyme such aduaun­
tage as his father had 
in his life. 
 
And note well, that 
in rent seck if a man be 
not seised of the rent, & 
it be behind he is without 

 

recouery, for that that 
it was his own folly 
at the beginninge when 
the rent was graunted 
to him, or reserued, that
he toke not seisin of the
rent as a pennye or 
two pence. And note 
wel that a man maye 
not haue a Cessauit per 
biennium, or an other 
writte of entrye sur 
Cessauit for no rent 
seck behinde by two 
yeares, but onely for 
rent seruice, as it ap­
peareth in the statute. 
 
And note wel that 
in rent secke it beeho­
ueth hym that sueth 
for the rent secke for 
to shewe a deede to 
the tenaunt, or els the 
tenaunt shall not bee 
charged with the rent 
but where the rent 
secke was rent seruice 
before, as in this case 
lord, mesne, and te­
naunt, and euerye of 
them holdeth of other 
by homage and fealty 

 

and the tenant of the 
Mesne x. s. of rent, 
the Lorde paramont 
purchaseth the landes 
or tenements of the te­
nant, all the seigniory 
of the Mesne but the 
rent is extinct. And 
for this cause this rent 
is become rent secke, & 
the rent seruice chaun­
ged, for hee may not 
distrain for this rent, 
& in this case hee that 
demandeth the rent shal 
neuer bee charged to 
shew a deede. Also in 
a writ of Mordaun­
cester, Ayle, or besaile 
of rent seck, it needeth 
not to shew a special­
tie, for that these writtes 
of possession do com­
prehend a title within 
them selues, that ys 
to say, that the aun­
cestour was seised of 
the same rent, & con­
tinued his possessyon, 
because of which sey­
sin the law supposeth 
that it is also auerable by 

 

the Countrey. Yet 
learne, for some sup­
pose that it behoueth 
of necessitie to shewe 
forth a deede, for that 
that rent secke ys a 
thing against common 
right, aswell as rent 
charge. But in Assise 
of Nouel disseisin, & in 
a writ of Entre sur dis­
seisin brought of rent 
secke, it behoueth of 
necessity to shew forth 
a deede, for that that 
rent seck is a thing a­
gainst a common right, 
except in the case be­
fore saide, where it 
was rent seruice be­
fore. And Assise of 
Nouel disseisin, & a writ 
of entre sur disseisin, con­
teine within them no 
title, but suppose a 
disseisin to be done to 
the plaintif, & of the en­
tendement of the law, 
the disseisin geueth no 
cause of auerrement a­
gainst common right, 
but of necessitie it be­

 

hooueth to shew forth 
a deede.
 
¶ Suit seruice.
Suit seruice is to 
come to the Court 
from iij. weekes to iij. 
weekes by the whole 
yeare, and for that a 
man shalbe distrayned 
& not amerced. 
 
Suit real is to come 
to the Court of leete, 
and that is not but ij. 
times in the yere, & for 
that a man shalbe a­
merced, and not 
distrayned.
