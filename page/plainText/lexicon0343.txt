TO THE RIGHT HO­
nourable, Sir Richard Boyle, Knight, 
Lord Boyle, Baron of Youghall, Viscount Dun­
garuan, Earle of Cork, and one of his Maie­
sties most Honourable Priuie Councell 
of the Kingdome of Ireland, &c.
PArt of euery desertfull birth, 
(Right Honourable) in any man 
his Country may challenge, his 
Soueraigne a part, his Parents a
part, & his friends another. As I 
cannot be vseful in euery respect to each of those, 
so I will striue to expresse at least a will, if not a 
perfection in abilitie to all. Where a generall 
voice warrants an approbation, there euery ser­
uice is a duty. The truth of it both concernes and 
inuites me, out of the fame and applause of your 
Noblenesse, to make a particular dedication of 
some serious houres to your suruey, whom the 
world speakes both noble and learned, wherein 
as I haue done my best to accommodate discourse 



with the choisest language, so I desire that my 
ambition of being knowne vnto your Lordship 
may not be imputed either vnto an errour of im­
pudence, or an impudence in erring. Please you 
to know thus much of me, that I am partly im­
boldned hereunto, by the assurance of your loue 
and fauours to that noble Gentleman, Sir Wil­
liam Hull, to whom as I am tied in double 
bonds of bloud and friendship, so, I am so much 
obliged vnto him, that I cannot deuise a better 
rent than to doe you seruice : But chiefely the re­
port of your owne honourable merit and iust 
commendations, encourage mee to this duty, 
though otherwise vnknowne, not questioning 
but you will be pleased to take notice of one who 
loues and honours vertue in all Personages for 
vertues sake. Vouchsafe (Right Honourable)
this poore testimonie of my obseruancie, intended 
only to serue you, not to instruct you, and you shall 
not onely largely requite my endeuours, but 
may also expect a more steady and particular du­
ty from
Your Honours most ready seruant,
Henry Cockeram.





A Premonition from the 
Author to the Reader.

I Am not ignorant of the 
praise-worthy labours which 
some Schollers of deserued 
memorie haue heretofore be­
stowed on the like subiect 
that I haue here aduentured on :
howsoeuer it might therefore 
seeme a needlesse taske of mine, to intrude vp­
on a plot of study, the foundation of whose buil­
ding hath beene formerly leuel'd and laid, yet the 
Iustice of defence herein is so cleere, that my en­
deuours may bee truly termed rather a necessity 
of doing, than an arrogancie in doing. For 
without appropriating to my owne comfort any 
interest of glory, the vnderstanding Readers will 
not, the ignorant cannot, and the malicious
dare not, but acknowledge that what any before
me in this kinde haue begun, I haue not onely



fully finished, but throughly perfected. To write 
an Apologie of iustification would argue rather 
a distrust of my Worke than a confidence of me­
rit :  Be pleased therefore (honest and (therin)
learned Reader) to suruey a short Premonition 
for the order of the ensuing Vocabularie. First 
the method is plaine and easie, being alphabeti­
call, by which the capacity of the meanest may 
soone be inlightened. The first Booke hath the 
choisest words themselues now in vse, where­
with our language is inriched and become so 
copious, to which words the common sense is 
annexed. The second Booke containes the 
vulgar words, which whensoeuer any desirous 
of a more curious explanation by a more refi­
ned and elegant speech shall looke into, he shall 
there receiue the exact and ample word to ex­
presse the same : Wherein by the way let me pray 
thee to obserue that I haue also inserted (as occa­
sion serued) euen the mocke-words which are ridi­
culously vsed in our language, that those who 
desire a generality of knowledge may not bee 
ignorant of the sense, euen of the fustian 
termes, vsed by too many who study rather 
to bee heard speake, than to vnderstand them­
selues. The last Booke is a recitall of seuerall per­
sons, Gods and Goddesses, Giants and Deuils, 
Monsters and Serpents, Birds and Beasts, Riuers, 
Fishes, Herbs, Stones, Trees, and the like, to 
the intent that the diligent learner may not pre­



tend the defect of any helpe which may informe 
his discourse or practice. I might insist vpon the 
generall vse of this worke, especially for La­
dies and Gentlewomen, Clarkes, Merchants, 
young Schollers, Strangers, Trauellers, and all 
such as desire to know the plenty of the English;
but I am confident, that experience will be the 
truest Herauld to publish to the world on my be­
halfe, how as my debt to my countrie is to bee 
challenged, so my Country shall not altogether 
boast of any immunity from being indebted to 
my Studies. Thus what I haue done is (Reader)
for thy benefit, accept it and make vse of it, so 
shall I finde reward in my labours, and rest thy 
friend,
H. C.








To his very good friend, Master 
Henry Cockeram, on his Vo­
cabulary.

He whose selfe loue, or too ambitious spirit,
Enuies or carpes at this thy Muses action,
Nere let him liue, or of a Muse once merit,
Regard or fame, but die in his detraction,
Irreuocably plagu'd with Zoilan spight,
Ere he once taste of Hellicons delight.

Could I, oh could I quintessence my skill,
Or with Elixir truly alcumize,
Knowledge with learning should instruct my quill.
Effectually to praise thy Muses guise,
Re-felling all the criticall disasters,
Among some captious, yet wise seeming masters,
Made by her curious eye, their owne distasters.
Nicholas Smith, Eques Auratus 
Encomiastes Posthumus.



To my industrious freind, the Au­
thor of this English Dictionarie,
Mr. HENRY COCKRAM
of EXETER.

BOrne in the West? liue there? so far from Court?
From Oxford, Cambridge, London? yet report
(Now in these daies of Eloquence) such change
Of words? vnknown? vntaught? tis new & strange.
Let Gallants therefore skip no more from hence 
To Italie, France, Spaine, and with expence 
Waste time and faire estates, to learne new fashions 
Of complementall phrases, smooth temptations
To glorious beggary : Here let them hand
This Book;  here studie, reade, and vnderstand :
Then shall they finde varietie at Home,
As curious as at Paris, or at Rome.
For my part I confesse, hadst not thou writ, 
I had not beene acquainted with more wit
Than our old English taught; but now I can 
Be proud to know I haue a Countryman
Hath strugled for a fame, and what is more, 
Gain'd it by paths of Art, vntrod before.



The benefit is generall; the crowne
Of praise particular, and thats thine owne.
What should I say? Thine owne deserts inspire thee, 
Twere base to enuie, I must then admire thee.
A friend and louer of thy paines,
IOHN FORD.



To the Reader on this Verball of his 
esteemed friend, Master Henry Cocke­
ram of Exeter.

ARt hidden moulds, the Author freely sends, 
His sweat of brow to publike priuat friends, 
His courtesie to labour, yours to raise,
As it deserues the countenance of praise.
Hard words far fetch'd, made smooth, before being rough,
Claime fauour for requitall, that's enough.
If you betray them with a trecherous kisse,
He'l laugh in's sleeue, and at your follies hisse.
Thomas Spicer.

To the Reader on this Vocabulary 
of his good friend, Master Henry Cocke­
ram of Exeter.

IF things farre fetch'd are dearest most esteem'd, 
which by times sweatful houres haue been redeem'd, 
Of what count's this,of which sort like was neuer, 
Praise it of force you must, and loue him euer.
The Adage is far sought, deare bought, please ladies, 
You must yeeld to this Maxime, or proue babies.
Then giue worths due, that worthinesses guise,
If not, my Motto is, you are vnwise.
Bartho. Hore.



To my very good friend, Master Co­
keram, Author of this worke.

TO speake good words of thee were but in part 
To pay backe what we owe, for thy rare Art 
Hath taught vs all good language : a rude pile 
Of barbarous sillables into a stile
Gentle and smooth thou hast reduc't : pure gold 
Thou hast extracted out of worthlesse mould.
And that no one may thinke thy merit weake, 
Of a rough speech th'ast taught vs all to speake
A perfect language ; in which Cockerams praise
Shall liue belou'd, whilst time leaues making daies. 
Iohn Day.

To his industrious friend, Master 
Henry Cockeram.

TO ouer-praise thy Booke, in a smooth line,
(If any errour's in't) would make it mine :
Onely, while Words, for paiment passe at Court;
And whilst loud talke and wrangling make resort 
I'th Terme to Westminster, I doe not dread
Thy leaues shall scape the Scombri, and be read.
And I will adde this as thy friend, no Poet,
Thou hast toild to purpose, and the euent will shew it.
Iohn Webster.



To his worthily respected friend, 
Master Henry Cockeram.

WHo hath discouer'd yet a neerer way,
By which, what we conceiue, we can conuey
To others, then by words, that full expresse
What Mimicke action doth but onely guesse:
But where a language hath variety,
And euery word a reall property,
How much it adds to elocution,
As doe but reade this Booke, then thinke vpon 
The Authors paines and praise, giue him respect 
For this addition to our Dialect.

Iohn Crugge.
