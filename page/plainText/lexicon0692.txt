¶ Infernus and gehenna differ moche in sig­
nificacion / though we have none other inter­
pretacion for ether of them / then this Engly­
she worde / hell. For gehenna signifieth a pla­
ce of punyshement: but infernus is taken for 
any maner of place beneth in the erth / as a gra­
ve sepulchre or cave.

Hell: it is called in Hebrue the valeye of 
Hennon. A place by Ierusalem / where they 
burnt their chyldren in fyer vnto the ydole 
Moloch / & is vsurped & taken now for a pla­
ce where the wycked and vngodlye shalbe to­
rmented both soule and bodye / after the gene­
rall iudgement.

Geue Rowme to the wrath of God. Rom. xii
wrath is there taken for vengeaunce. And the 
meaninge is: let God advenge / ether by him
selfe or by the officers that beare his rowme.
rom. xxii
 
There tarye & abyde tyll ye go oute. Yt is 
in Marke the .vi. Wheresoever ye enter in 
to an house / there abyde till ye go oute thence. 
And Luke .ix. it is / into what soever housse ye 
enter / ther tarye / and go not oute thence: that 
is to saye / whosoever receaveth you / there



abyde as longe as you are in the citie or tou­
ne / and go not shamefully a beggynge from 
housse to housse as freers do.

Dust: shake of the dust of youre fete. Mat­
thew. x. Why are they commaunded to shake 
of the dust? For a wytnes sayth Luke. That 
that dede maye testifie agaynst them in the 
daye of iudgement / that the doctrine of salva­
cion was offered them / but they wolde not re­
ceave it. Ye se also that soche gestures and ce­
remonies haue greater power with them / then 
have bare wordes onlye / to move the harte & 
to stere vp fayth / as do the layenge on of han­
des and anoyntinge with oyle. &c.
mat. x.

Ypocrytes / can ye decerne the face of hea­
ven and not decerne the signe of the tymes? 
That is to saye: they coulde iudge by the sig­
nes of the skye what wether shuld folowe: 
but coulde not knowe Christ by the signes of 
the scripture. And yet other signe myght not 
be geven them.
math. xvi

He that sayth he knoweth Christ and ke­
peth not his commaundementes / ys a lyar. To 
knowe Christ is to beleve in Christ. Ergo he 
that kepeth not the commaundementes / be­
leveth not in Christ.
