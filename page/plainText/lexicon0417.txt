pers, and notice taken therein of things convenient to the furthe足
rance of a Plantation at Saint Laurence, I am deprived of some good
parts of their language or speech, which in my conceit was not dif足
ficult to attaine; but perusing an old table booke I found some few
words of their language, penned downe for my remembrance, which



are somewhat difficult at present to reade, being 14 yeares agoe writ足
ten in such imperfect Manuscript.

Yet I thought it not amisse to penn downe what I have lately
found, which with the helpe of others especially of one William Casey 
late Purser of an Indian ship, who took more paines therin then my 
selfe (if his papers can be found) will give some light therein to the 
helpe of others that will endeavour to attaine the knowledge thereof; 
the particulars which I have now found I will here manifest so well 
as I can.
