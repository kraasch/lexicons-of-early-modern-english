To the right honourable,
Worshipfull, vertuous, & godlie
Ladies, the Lady Hastings, the Lady
Dudley, the Lady Mountague, the Ladie
Wingfield, and the Lady Leigh, his Chri­
stian friends, R. C. wisheth great prosperitie in this
life, with increase of grace, and peace from GOD
our Father, through Iesus Christ our Lord and
onely Sauiour. 

BY this Table (right Honourable & Wor­
shipfull) strangers that blame our tongue
of difficultie, and vncertaintie may heere­
by plainly see, & better vnderstand those
things, which they haue thought hard. Heerby
also the true Orthography, that is, the true
writing of many hard English words, borrowed
from the Greeke, Latine & French, and how to
know one from the other, with the interpretati­
on thereof by plaine English words, may be lear­
ned and knowne. And children heereby may be
prepared for the vnderstanding of a great num­
ber of Latine words: which also will bring much
delight & iudgement to others, by the vse of this
little worke. Which worke, long ago for the most
part, was gathered by me, but lately augmented
by my sonne Thomas, who now is Schoolemai­
ster in London.





 
Now when I had called to mind (right hono­
rable and Worshipfull) the great kindnesse, and
bountifulnes, which I found in that vertuous &
godly Lady, Lucie Harington, your Honours
and Worships mother, and my especiall friend in
the Lord. When, and at such time as the right
Worshipfull SirIames Harington Knight,
your Ladiships brother was my scholler, (and
now my singuler benefactor) when I taught the
Grammer schoole at Okeham in the County of
 Rutland: In consideration whereof, and also
for that I acknowledge my selfe much beholding
and indebted to the most of you, since this time,
(beeing all naturall sisters) I am bold to make
you all ioyntly patrons heereof, and vnder your
names to publish this simple worke. And thus
praying, that God of his vnspeakeable mercies,
will blesse both your Honors and Worships, I doe
with all good wishes to you all, with all yours, as
to mine owne soule, humbly take my leaue. Co­
uentry this xxvij. of Iune. 1604. 

Your Honors and Worships, euer
ready in Christ Iesus to be com­
maunded, Robert Cawdrey.








SVch as by their place and calling,
(but especially Preachers) as haue oc­
casion to speak publiquely before the
ignorant people, are to bee admoni­
shed, that they neuer affect any strange
ynckhorne termes, but labour to speake so
as is commonly receiued, and so as the most
ignorant may well vnderstand them: ney­
ther seeking to be ouer fine or curious, nor
yet liuing ouer carelesse, vsing their speech,
as most men doe, & ordering their wits, as
the fewest haue done. Some men seek so far
for outlandish English, that they forget al­
together their mothers language, so that if
some of their mothers were aliue, they were
not able to tell, or vnderstand what they say,
and yet these fine English Clearks, will say
they speak in their mother tongue; but one
might well charge them, for counterfeyting
the Kings English. Also, some far iournied
gentlemen, at their returne home, like as they
loue to go in forraine apparrell, so they will
pouder their talke with ouer-sea language.
He that commeth lately out of France, will
talk French English, and neuer blush at the





 
matter. Another chops in with English Ita­
lianated, and applyeth the Italian phrase to
our English speaking, the which is, as if an
Orator, that professeth to vtter his minde in
plaine Latine, would needs speake Poetrie,
& far fetched colours of strange antiquitie.
Doth any wise man think, that wit resteth in
strange words, or els staandeth it not in whol­
some matter, and apt declaring of a mans
mind? Do we not speak, because we would
haue other to vnderstand vs? or is not the
tongue giuen for this end, that one might
know what another meaneth? Therefore,
either wee must make a difference of Eng­
lish, & say, some is learned English, & other­
some is rude English, or the one is Court
talke, the other is Country-speech, or els we
must of necessitie banish all affected Rhe­
torique, and vse altogether one manner of
language. Those therefore that will auoyde
this follie, and acquaint themselues with the
plainest & best kind of speech, must seeke
from time to time such words as are commonlie
receiued, and such as properly may expresse
in plaine manner, the whole conceit of their
mind. And looke what words wee best vn­
derstand, and know what they meane, the





 
same should soonest be spoken, and first ap­
plied, to the vttrance of our purpose. Ther­
fore for this end, foure things would chiefly
be obserued in the choise of wordes. First,
that such words as wee vse, should be pro­
per vnto the tongue wherein we speake. A­
gaine, that they be plaine for all men to per­
ceiue. Thirdly, that they be apt and meete,
most properly to set out the matter. Fourth­
lie, that words translated, from one signifi­
cation to another, (called of the Grecians
Tropes,) be vsed to beautifie the sentence, as
precious stones are set in a ring, to commend
the gold. Now such are thought apt words,
that properly agree vnto that thing, which
they signifie, and plainly expresse the nature
of the same. Therefore, they that haue re­
gard of their estimation and credite, do wa­
rily speake, & with choise, vtter words most
apt for their purpose. In waightie causes,
graue wordes are thought most needfull,
that the greatnes of the matter, may the ra­
ther appeare, in the vehemencie of theyr
talke. So likewise of other, like order must
be taken. Albeit some, not onely doe not
obserue this kind of aptnesse, but also they
fall into much fondnes, by vsing words out





 
of place, and applying them to diuers mat­
ters, without all discretion.

If thou be desirous (gentle Reader) right­
ly and readily to vnderstand, and to profit
by this Table, and such like, then thou must
learne the Alphabet, to wit, the order of the
Letters as they stand, perfectly without
booke, and where euery Letter standeth: as
(b) neere the beginning, (n) about the mid­
dest, and (t) toward the end. Nowe if the
word, which thou art desirous to finde, be­
gin with (a) then looke in the beginning of
this Table, but if with (v) looke towards
the end. Againe, if thy word beginne with
(ca) looke in the beginning of the letter (c)
but if with (cu) then looke toward the end
of that letter. And so of all the rest. &c.

And further vnderstand, that whereas all
such words as are deriued & drawne from the
Greek, are noted with this letter, (g). And
the French are marked thus (§) but such
words as are deriued from the latin, haue no
marke at all.
