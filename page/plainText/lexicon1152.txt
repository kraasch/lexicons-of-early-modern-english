mater: and hath to name the
boke of surueyeng and
improumentes






A curtylage  
is a lytell croft or court / or place of easment to put in 
catell for a tyme / or to ley in woode / cole / or tymbre / or 
suche other thynges necessary for housholde.

 

ye shall vnderstande that there be foure ma­
ner of commens / that is to wytte: commen appendant 
commen appurtenaunt / commen in grose / and com­
men per cause vicynage .s. neyghbourshepe. Com­
men appendaunt / is where a lorde of olde tyme hath 
graunted to a man a meseplace / and certayne landes 
medowes / and pastures with their appurtenaunces 
to holde of hym. To this meseplace / landes / and me­
dowes belongeth commen / and that is called commen 
appendaunt. But and a man graunt to another cer­
tayne landes or pastures / the whiche lye in seueraltie 
enclosed with the appurtenaunce in fee / to holde of the



chefe lordes. To these landes me semeth belongeth no 
commen / without he haue suche speciall wordes in his 
dede. Commen appendaunt / is where a man hath had commen to a certayne nombre of beestes or without nom­
bre belongyng to his meseplace in the lordes wastes / 
this is commen appurtenaunte by prescripcyon / by­
cause of the vse out of tyme of mynde. Commen in­
grose / is where the lordes haue graunted by their de­
des / commen of pasture to a straunger that holdeth 
no landes of hym / nor ought to haue any commen / but 
by reason of that graunt by dede. Nowe the lordes 
maye nat improue hym selfe of any parcell / for it is 
contrarie to his graunt / thoughe there be sufficyent 
of commen. And in lyke case / if the lorde graunt com­
men to a man by dede / and to lymitte him a certayne 
nombre of beestes. Se what was commen at that ty­
me and of that the lorde shall nat improue hym selfe / 
for and he shulde / the goodnesse of the commen to that 
certayne nombre shulde be abridged that they shulde 
nat fare so well / and euery mannes dede shall be taken 
strongest agaynst hym selfe. And in lyke maner / if the 
lorde graunt a man commen with his catell / within 
certayne meyres / lymittes / & boundes / the lorde shall 
nat improue hym selfe / within those meyres and boun­
des. Commen per cause de vicynage / is where the wast 
grounde of two towneshippes lye toguyder / and no­
ther hedge nor pale bytwene to kepe their catell a son­
der / so that the catell of one towneshyppe gothe ouer 
his meyre or bounde in to the waste grounde of the o­
ther towne / and lykewise the catell of the other town­



shyppe to them. And also if their commen feldes lye 
toguyder vnclosed / in opyn tyme whan haruest is in 
their catell wyll go out of the one felde in to the other 
felde / and this is called commens / bycause of neygh­
bourshyp / and is nat vsed nor laufull to pynne their 
catell so goyng / but in good maner to driue and cha­
ce besyde suche commen. And as for that maner of com­
mens / me semeth the lorde may improwe him selfe of 
their wast groundes / leauyng their owne tenauntes 
sufficyent commen / hauyng no regarde to the tenaun­
tes of the other towneshyp. But as for all errable lan­
des / medowes / leyse / and pastures / the lordes maye 
improwe them selfe by course of the commen lawe / for 
the statute speketh nothynge but of wast groundes.



Also it is to be inque­
red / of panage herbage of the same towne / 
and of all other profytes of polles / meyres / and ryn­
nyng waters / of mores / hethe and wastes / what they 
be worthe by the yere. And where this Statute spe­
keth / de panagio / that is to be vnderstande. Whane
there is any mast growyng in the lordes wodes / wher­
by mennes swyne may be fedde and releued / what pro­
fyte that may be to the lorde. For ther is no man that 
can clayme of right / to haue the mast the whiche is a 
frute / but the lorde: except his free tenaunt haue it by 
speciall wordes in his dede.



And first ye shall 
knowe / that there be thre maner of rentes / that is to 
saye: rent seruyce / rent charge / and rent seeke. Rent 
seruyce / is where a man holdeth his landes of his lorde 
by fealtie & certayne rent / or by homage / fealtie & cer­
tayne rent / or by any other seruice and certayne rent. 
This is a rent seruyce / & if the rent be behynde at any 
day that it ought to be payed at / the lord may distreyne 
for that rent of commen right / and if the lorde purchase 
parcell of the sayd lande that the rent gothe out of / the 
rent shalbe apporcyoned: except it be an enttere rent /



as a sperhauke / or a horse / or suche other that can nat 
be seuered / for than the rent is extinct and gone for e­
uer. &c. Rent charge / is where a man is seased of lan­
des in fee and graunt by poole dede or by dede inden­
ted. Annuell rent goyng out of the same landes in fee 
or in fee tayle or for terme of lyfe / with a clause of dy­
stresse that is a rent charge / and the grauntee maye di­
streyne for the same rent / bycause of the clause of dy­
stresse. But if the graunte purchase parcell of the sayd 
landes / wherof the sayd rent gothe out / the hole rent 
charge is extynct and gone for euer. For suche a rent 
charge maye nat be apporcioned / bycause the landes 
come to his owne possession by his owne acte or dede 
Rent seeke / is where a man is seased of landes in fee 
graunt / a rent goyng out of the same without a clau­
se of distresse / that is a rent seeke and it is called a rent 
seeke / bycause there is no distresse insedent nor belon­
gyng to the same. Also if a man by dede indented ma­
ke a feoffement in fee or in fee tayle / the remayndre o­
uer in fee or for terme of lyfe remeyner ouer in fee / re­
seruyng to hym certayne rente without any clause of 
distresse in the same. That is a rent seeke / and if the 
graunte were neuer seased of the said rent / he is with 
out remayndre by course of the commen lawe. There is 
another maner of rent: that is nother rente seruyce / 
rent charge / nor rent seeke / and that is called rent an­
nuell. And that is / where as a man graunteth by his 
dede / an annuitie of .xx.s. be it more or lasse / and char­
geth no lande with the payment of the same. That is 
a rent annuell / and it chargeth the person that graun­



teth the sayd rent by a writte of annuite / and in some 
cause a rent charge / may become an annuell rent. as 
and a man graunt a rente charge out of his lande with 
a clause of dystresse / the graunte is at lybertie / whe­
der he wyll distreyne for the rent / or sewe a writ of an­
nuyte agaynst the graunter.

"rent annuell" not found in OED. "insedent" antedates the earliest OED citation (1594), and it is a noun, not an adjective.





And ye shall vnderstande / that 
there be two maner of herryottes: that is to wyt / her­
ryot seruyce and herryot custome. Herryot seruyce / 
is where a man hath gyuen landes and tenementes to



another man and to his heyres / to holde of hym and 
of his heyres / as before the makynge of the statute / 
Quia emptores terrarum / or sythe the makyng of the 
sayd statute to holde of the chefe lorde of the fee / by the 
seruyce therof due & of right accustomed / reseruyng 
to hym certayne rentes / herryottes / or any other cu­
stome. This is rent seruyce and herryot seruyce / by­
cause it is expressed in his origynall dede. Herryotte 
custome is where a man hath a lordship / wherin hath 
ben vsed tyme out of mynde / that euery tenaunt that 
holdeth any mese place of the lorde / shall gyue his best
quycke good in the name of a herryotte to the lorde / 
and he that hath no quicke good / shall gyue his best 
deed good. And in some place the tenaunt shall gyue 
for euery mese place that he holdeth a herryot / thoughe 
the houses were lette downe an hundred yere before / 
the whiche me semeth shulde be a great bribery and 
extorcyon / as I sayd in the prologue of this treatyse. 
And therfore it is wisdome for euery man to take his 
house by indenture or by copye / wherin maye be ex­
pressed: what rentes / herryottes / customes / and ser­
uyces the tenaunt shall paye and do / for a lorde maye 
abridge and make lesse his custome by writyng but 
thoughe he make writyng and specifye what rent he 
shall paye / he must saye further / for all maner rentes / 
herryottes / customes / & seruyces. And in some lorde­
shyppe / euery man that dyeth within the same / be he 
the lordes tenaunt or nat / shall paye an herryotte. In 
so moche that if a straunge man ryde or go by the way



and dye within suche a lordshyppe / he shall paye an 
herryot / the whiche is playne extorcyon and agaynst 
the commen ryght / For bytwene the lorde and hym 
that dyed / there was no maner of priuyte of bargayn 
or couynaunt. And in some lordshyppe / the lorde shall 
take his herryotte before the person / or the vycare his 
mortuarye / & in some places the churche before / And 
that is / as it hath ben accustomed and vsed tyme out 
of mynde. But for the moost parte / the lorde taketh 
before: bicause the lorde maketh couynaunt with his 
tenaunt in his lyfe / that he shall haue his best quycke 
good at his decesse / and the mortuary is nat due tyll 
he be deed / and the herryotte was couynaunted and 
graunted before in his lyfe / and the firste bargayne 
must be obserued and kepte. And also in some pla­
ces it is parted bytwene the churche & the lorde / and 
that is / where he that is deed hath no moore quycke 
good / but one horse or one beest / and than he that hath 
be vsed to chose first / shall haue the better parte by one 
penny / but of deed good / eyther partie shall haue one 
But there shall nother of them take any deed good / 
as longe as there is any quycke goodes / and in ma­
ny lordshyppes / it is vsed / that and the tenaunt leaue 
his house by his owne wyll / without any discharge 
of the lorde / the tenaunt shall pay his best quicke good 
to the lorde in the name of an herryot. & in some lord­
shippes it is acustomed / that & the tenant departe fro the 
lordshyp by his owne wyll / he shall make a fyne with 
the lorde for his departyng / & moost commenly it is .ii.s.



and it is called a farefee or a farewell. And suche a te­
naunt that gothe at his owne wyll shall make all ma­
ner of reparacyons / and that tenaunt that is dyschar­
ged by the lorde or by his offycers / shall make no re­
paracions / except he be discharged for nat doyng re­
peracions. &c.

"herryot custome" antedates the earliest OED citation (1767).





And ye shall vnderstande / that ho­
mage is the moost honorable seruyce & the moost hum­
ble seruyce of reuerence / that a free man may do to his 
lorde. For whan the tenaunt shall do homage to his 
chefe lorde / of whome he holdeth his chefe maner or man­
cyon place / by knight seruyce and priorite. He shalbe 
vngirde and his heed vncouered / and the lorde shall 
syt & the tenaunt shall knele before hym on bothe his 
knees / and shall holde his handes stretched out togy­
der bytwene the lordes handes / and shall saye thus. 
I become your man from this day forwarde of lyfe 
and of membre / and of worldely honour. And to you 
shall be faythfull and lowly and shall beare faythe to 
you / for the landes and tenementes the which I holde 
of you / sauyng the faythe that I owe to our soueray­
gne lorde the kyng and my other lordes. And the lorde 
so sytting shall kysse his tenaunt / the which is a sygne



of perfyte loue.



The name of a surueyour  is a frenche name / and is 
as moche to say in Englysshe as an ouerseer. Than 
it wolde be knowen / howe a surueyour shulde ouer­
se & suruey a towne or a lordshyppe / as and the cytie 
of London shulde be surueyed. The surueyour may 
nat stande at Hygate / nor at Shotershyll / nor yet at the 
Blackheth nor suche other places / and ouer loke 
the cytie on euery syde. For and he do / he shall nat se 
the goodly stretes / the fayre buyldinges / nor the great 
substaunce of richesse conteyned in them / for than he

fol. 34v
maye be called a disceyuer & nat a surueyer. & in lyke 
wise if a man shall vieu a close or a pasture / he maye 
nat loke ouer the hedge & go his way / but he must ou­
ther ryde or go ouer / & se euery parcell therof. and to 
knowe howe many acres it conteyneth / & howe moche 
therof was medowe grounde / howe moche pasture 
grounde / howe moche wode grounde or busshe groun­
de / heythe / lyng / or suche other. & what an acre of me­
dowe grounde is worthe / and what an acre of pasture 
and what an acre of the woode grounde or busshe / & 
suche other be worthe. And what maner of catell it is 
best for / and howe many catell it wyll grasse or fynde 
by the yere / and what a beastes grasse is worthe by 
the yere in suche a pasture / or els he can nat set a true 
value what it is worthe.

If Fitzherbert means "discerner" ("disceyuer" is not in OED), the term antedates the first OED citation (1526).





FIrst ye shall vnderstande / that there be 
dyuers maners of waters: that is to say 
standyng waters / as poles / meyres / mot­
tes / and stewes. And also ronnyng wa­
ters / as great ryuers / smale ryuers / bro­
kes / sucches / welspringes / and pyttes

fol. 50v
ALso vpon these waters / the lorde maye 
sette dyuers maner of mylnes / the whi­
che maye be to the lordes great ease and 
profite. As vpon the great riuers / corne 
mylnes that be called grounde mylnes / 
and they be called grounde mylnes / bycause the ouer­
syde of the heed sylle lyeth euyn leuell with the ouer­
syde of the grounde / in the bottom of the water. And 
also fullyng mylnes / otherwyse called walk mylnes / 
may be made in like maner / and stande also vpon the 
great ryuers. And than one whele is able to driue two 
stockes / that is to say / bothe a potyer and a faller / the 
faller bothe to scoure and herely / and the potyere to 
thicke the clothe. And commenly these mylnes be nat 
set vpon the great stremes of these great ryuers / but 
a great parte of the water is conueyed out of the great 
streme by a mylne fleme made with mannes hande to 
a certayne place / where wysemen thynke the mylne 
moost conuenyent to be set / & the sayd water to be hol­
den vp and brought to the said mylne / by reason and 
settyng of a weyre ouerthwart the sayd streme / made 
of trouse / tymbre / or stonne / or of bothe. And whan it 
is palte the mylne with a suffycient fall of the water / 
that the mylne stande nat in backe water / to retourne 
in to the ryuer agayne. and in many places / the said

fol. 51r
mylnes be set on the one syde of the great ryuer / and 
a weyre made of tymbre and stone to holde vp the wa­
ter to the mylne / the whiche is a great cost / and ma­
ny tymes it wyll stande in lacke of water that it may 
nat well go at a great flode / except the groundewarke 
be made very hie. But they be profitable bothe in grin­
dynge of corne and fullyng of clothe / and in takynge 
of moche fysshe. And in lyke maner these sayde two 
maner of mylnes maye be sette vpon smale ryuers / 
without any fleme castyng / but all onely his weyre to 
holde vp the water / and his flode gates to let it go at 
a flode / whan nede shall requyre. Also there be other 
two maner of corne mylnes / that is to saye: a breste 
mylne and an ouershotte mylne / and those two ma­
ner of mylnes be sette and go moost commenly vpon 
smale brokes / and vpon great poles & meyres. And 
they haue alway abrode bowe a fote brode and more 
and the ladelles be alwaye shrowded with compast 
bordes on bothe sides to holde in the water / and than 
they be called bokettes. And they muste be set moche 
nerer toguyder than the ladelles be / and moche more 
a sloope downewarde / to holde moche water that it 
fall nat out / for it driueth the whele as well with the 
weyght of the water as with the strength. And the myl­
ner must drawe his water acordyng to his bokettes / 
that they maye be alway full and no more / for the len­
ger that they holde the water the better they be. Also 
another maner of fullyng mylnes / maye be sette and 
go vpon the sayde smale brokes / pooles / or meyres.

fol. 51v
and those be called fallers / for a faller by hymselfe re­
quyreth nat so great strength of water as the potyer 
dothe / bycause the water cometh most commenly ouer 
the whele / and the braces do butte heue vp the two 
fete that fall in to the stocke vpon the clothe / the whi­
che causeth the clothe to thicke and tourne. Also these 
mylnes that be sette and go on small waters / may go 
and ron with a gogyn of yron vpon bulder stones or 
vpon brasse as a bell dothe / for that wyll go moost ligh­
test. But these mylnes that go vpon these great ry­
uers / that be brode / heuy / and weighty / must nedes 
haue two great thycke hoopes of yron foure inches 
brode / and an inche thycke: and eight or nyne inches 
bytwene the sydes / sette on bothe endes of the shafte / 
for the gogyn of yron wyll nat beare them / and speci­
ally the fullynge mylne. And that mylne that gothe 
with a gogyn / yet must it haue on eyther ende of the 
shafte a hoope of yron and bulders vnder / and if the 
gogyn feyle or waxe lose / but it shall nat touche them 
bothe attones. And lette the mylner take good hede 
bothe to the gogyns and hoopes that they be nat lose 
for than wyll the shafte endes brenne of. For than he 
hurteth his lorde / his mayster / or hymselfe / for mylne 
shaftes be costely. But in so moche as there is great 
profyte to the lordes in makyng of these mylnes /

"standing water" (unlike "running water") is not in OED as a phrase (however, it is cited in a quotation of 1542 at "water," n., 11). "ground mill" and "brest mill" not found in OED. "ouershotte mylne" antedates earliest OED citation ("overshot,: adj.1 and n; 1760). The term "potyer" is unidentified.
