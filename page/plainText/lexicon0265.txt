IOVRNALL, OR DAY­
ly Register,
CONTAYNING A TRVE
manifestation, and Historicall declaration of the
voyage, accomplished by eight shippes of Amsterdam, vnder
the conduct of Iacob Corneliszen Neck Admirall, & Wybrandt
van Warwick Vice-Admirall, which sayled from Amster­
dam the first day of March,
1598.

SHEWING THE COVRSE THEY
kept, and what other notable matters happened
vnto them in the sayd voyage.

Imprinted at London for Cuthbert Burby & Iohn Flasket:
And are to be sold at the Royall Exchange, & at the signe
of the blacke beare in Paules Church-yard.

A repetition of more plaine mani­
festation, of such things as we found and saw in the 
Island Mauritius, and of such matters as we there did
in the time of our abode. No. 2.



1 THese are Torteyses which liue on the land, and haue
no finnes to swimme, being so great, that they will
creepe away with a man standing on their shelles, which
they carrie on their backs, & they liue vpon crabs, which
are as bigge as a mans foote. 

2 Is a fowle altogether as bigge as a Swanne, hauing
two or three curled feathers behinde at her taile, without
any wings, but in place of wings they haue three or foure
smal black Quils: of which fowle we caught some, with
store of Turtle Doues, and other birds, which our Marri&
ners with great ioy brought aboord, dealing to euery ship
part of their wild fowle, after they were first sent a shore
to search for the deepest fresh riuers, and what harbour
there was for our shippes: whereupon the next day wee
went to the hauen with our shippes, taking one of those
Marriners into euerie shippe for a Pilot, which had beene
ashore the day before. These fowles we dressed and sod,
but we found them so tough, that we could not (how long
soeuer they sod) seethe them tender, but were faine to eate
them so tough as they were. As soone as wee were entred
into the Hauen, our Vice-Admirall sent some of vs with



the long boate ashore, to spie if there were any inhabi&
tants in the Iland, but wee found no creatures, except
onely great quantitie of Turtle Doues, and other birds,
whereof we caught, and killed with cudgels, great num­
bers: for seeing they had not beene accustomed to be fea­
red by any people there inhabiting, they had no feare of
vs, but would sit still, suffering themselues to bee killed
with staues and cudgels. To be short, it is a plentifull
land of fish and fowle, and so abundant, that in all our
voyage we found not the like.

3 This is a Palme tree, which carrieth leaues so great,
that a man may shrowd himselfe with one of them from
the raine, and not be wet: if in this tree a hole bee bored,
and a quill or tap put into the same, immediately there
runneth out wine or liquour, hauing a sweete and plea­
sant taste like vnto sacke, but if it bee kept three or foure
dayes, it waxeth sowre, and therefore it is called the
Palme tree. 

4 This is a bird or fowle, which we called Rabos Forca­
dos, for that their tayles are in shape resembling a
Taylers sheeres: they were very tame, and little lesse
then a fadome long, when they were stretched out: their
bils are long, their backes most part blacke, and their
breasts white: they eate flying fishes which they catch,
and the guttes or garbell of other fish and fowle, as wee
found by experience: for when we cast abroad our garbell
of such fish and fowle as we had taken, yea of their owne
kind, they would straightwayes come and deuoure the
same: their flesh would not be sodden tender. 

5 Is a bird, which we named an Indian Rauen, almost
as big againe as a Parret, they are of two or three sun­
drie colours.

6 Is a wild tree, whereon (for a memorie if any other
ships should there arriue) is nayled a board, hauing three



scutcheons or armes grauen or cut thereon, to wit, the
armes of Holland, Zealand and Amsterdam: to the end
they may know that ships of Holland haue beene at that
place.

7 This is a Palmites tree, whereof our Marriners cut
downe many and cut out the pith (marked with the letter
A) which we found to be an excellent remedie against
the scurvie disease: it is some three or foure foote long,
within very white, and hath a sweete taste. Some of our
people ate the pith of 7. or 8. of these plants.

8 A Bat or flying Mouse, hauing a head like vnto a
Monkie, and flie in this Iland in great numbers, they
hang themselues on the trees by the wings, and often
times they fight and bite one the other.

"flying mouse" antedates the earliest OED citation (1607, then 1934), but used for the Pontic mouse, not the bat.



9 Here our Smith set vp a forge to repaire our broken
iron workes, and such other things as were needfull to be
mended aboard the ships. 

10 These are cottages made by vs of trees and boughes,
where our Smith and Coopers did forge and hoope their
Caske, that we might bee readie to sayle thence with the
first faire wind.

11 At this place our Preacher made euerie Sunday two
Sermons: in the morning one half of our people went
ashore, and at afternoone the other halfe, to heare the ser­
mon.
In this place was a man christened, borne in the I­
land of Madagascar, and named Laurence,
with one or
two of our company which had not beene christened. 

12 Here we tooke so great abundance of fish, that it may
seeme incredible to be written, yea at one draft we tooke
two barrels and a helfe of many sorts.







Some words of the Malish speech, which
language is vsed throughout the East Indies, as
French is in our Countrie, wherewith a man may trauell
ouer all the Land. The Portugals speech is apt and pro­
fitable in these Islands, for there are many Inter­
preters which speake Portugall.
