THE 
PREFACE. 

'TIS not barely my Obligation to Cu­
stom, that has prevail'd with me to
present the courteous Reader with a 
Preface to the following Essay, but
rather the necessity and usefulness thereof in
a Work of this nature, that he might not be
surpriz'd, when, after having read the Title, he
should fall foul upon what is promised therein,
without any Instructions so to do.

In the first place therefore, I desire the Rea­
der to take notice of the
Method.
I. Of its Division into three Heads.
The first, Of Common Names.
The second, Of such Proper Names as are of a
German Original.
The third, Of Proper Names derived from
the Latin, Greek, or Hebrew, with their signi­
fication. All done by way of Alphabet; so that any Word
desired, may be quickly found.



II. Observe that all along, through the Book,
that Word is set next the English, from which
I have judged it most likely to be derived; and
the Synonymous Words of the other European
Languages follow: Which shews, I have left it to
the Opinion of the Reader, to draw it from which
he pleases. Moreover, by a curious reading here­
of, any of the European Languages may be indif­
ferently well learned.

III. Note, that very many of the Words being
of a British or Saxon Original, have their Ex­
plication set down.

The chief Reason why I busied my self here­
in, was, to save my Time from being worse em­
ployed: And, I did imagine (as, questionless,
these most indefatigable and ingenious Persons
did, viz.  Kilian, Vossius, Salmasius, Martinius,
Spelman, Bochart, Junius, Menagius and Skin­
ner, from whom I took my Pattern) I could
not spend it more commendably, or profitably,
than in searching into the Original of my Na­
tive Language; which is so strangely corrupted
through Time, that when I look'd an hundred,
or an hundred and fifty Years only behind me,
I could scarce imagine it ever to have been
the Language of my Ancestors, or even of the Coun­
try I was born in, 'tis so chang'd through Com­
merce,



Correspondence, Travellers, and such
like Accidents: Much more may you imagine
it to be alter'd in a thousand, or two thousand
Years, by Conquests, Invasions, Transmigra­
tions of Government, &c. which have been
very frequent over, and in this Isle, above
others: So that though this my native Country
might, at its first Settlement, have a Language
peculiar to it self; yet, as is said before, by
Conquest, Commerce, Travelling, Transmigra­
tions of the Government, &c. it is brought to
what we now find it, even a Composition of most,
if not all the Languages of Europe; especially
of the Belgick or Low-Dutch, Saxon, Teuto­
nick or High-Dutch, Cambro-British or Welsh,
French, Spanish, Italian, and Latin; and now
and then of the Old and Modern Danish, and
Ancient High-Dutch; also of the Greek, He­
brew, Arabick, Chaldee, Syriack and Turcick.

But I have forbore, as much as possible, the
setting down such as are purely of a Latin Ori­
ginal, lest the Book should exceed the quantity
of Sheets design'd, and so possibly the Price of
the Buyer; it having been the only Fault of those
that have hitherto writ upon this Subject, to
be both voluminous, high-pric'd, and in Latin;
so that many Well-wishers to their Mother-Tongue
could neither reach the Value nor Knowledge thereof:
All which I hope I have remedied, by



doing this in English, and in a small Volume,
fitted to a small Price.

I have (that the Reader might not be at
a loss in such Words as are purely from
the Latin) prefix'd a few easie Rules, whereby ma­
ny thousand English Words coming therefrom may
most easily be known, and made Latin again, usual­
ly, by the Addition, Cutting off, or Changing of
a Letter

The Confusion of Languages at Babel (for
before it, all the then World spoke one and
the same Dialect, supposed to be Hebrew) gave
Rise to all the several Languages in the Uni­
verse; of which, the primitive Language of
this Nation was one; and, had it not been
corrupted, perhaps as good and intelligible as the
best; but being so alter'd by the aforesaid
Accidents, it has quite lost its primitive Glo­
ry, as well as that of the French, and other
Nations.

It may be justly wonder'd at, why we have
no more Words than we have from the Old
British, now the Welsh (which, no doubt, was
the Primitive Language of this Nation:) But
if we again consider how imperiously the Saxons
enter'd and subdued this Land, our Wonder
will in a great measure abate; for they did not,



 as Conquerors usually do, mix the Britains with
themselves, after they had yielded to, or were
not any ways able to resist the Conqueror; but
put all to the Sword that they met withal; on­
ly some few, to shelter themselves from their
Rage, betook themselves to the Mountains of
Wales and Cornwall; which being inaccessable
to the Conquerors, for want of use, were suf­
ficient Security to the distressed Britains, against
them; which Quarter they do still live in, and
retain their own Language, for the most part,
within themselves, as if they were another Na­
tion; only by Commerce and Intercourse, there
has happen'd some Commutation of Language like­
wise. So that our Language, in the main, is
composed of the Old English-Saxon, Dutch and
Normandy-French; but of the first principally,
for that the last did only in part subdue, not
destroy this Nation, which the former did endea­
vour, and almost effect.

I might have added the Italian, because of
its Affinity to the French; as also because of
the great and frequent Communication there
was, in former Times, between England and
Italy, when this Nation was subject to the
Pope of Rome: For then all Ecclesiastical
Controversies, Confirmations of Priests, Abbots
and Bishops, in their several Benefices, were
to be solemnized and ratified by Rome's spiritual



Trader, the Pope: And, on the other
hand, the Pope sent hither many of his Crea­
tures, Italians, for the better collecting of his
Peter's Pence; as also for their Preferment to
Bishopricks, Vicarages, &c.

Though the Danes did, in some part sub­
due England, yet we are little beholding to
them for the Corruption we now labour under,
except it be in the North and West of England;
which they subdued almost two hundred Years
before the rest of the Nation came in to their
Obedience; and when they had it, they did not
possess it above forty Years before the Normans
disturb'd them in their Enjoyments.

In a Word, All Words almost (except such as
come from the French and Latin, with their Ad­­
herents) owe their Original to the English-Saxon
and Low-Dutch, Dialects of the ancient Ger­
man; for Spain did very little contribute there­
to, except that some few Words have crept in by
Commerce, which are only useful to such as
trade thither.

Now, lest any one, more ignorant, should
not be perswaded of the vast Alterations,
and sometimes total Changes that have been
made in our Language, since this Isle was
first discover'd, let him read some of our



Chronicles of England, and he will be con­
vinc'd of the necessity thereof; for the Saxons
did endeavour the total Destruction of the
Inhabitants, and did effect it, saving some
few that fled to the Mountains of Wales and
Cornwall, as is said before: And then is it
not reasonable to conjecture, that the Language,
the Ancient British (save what was preserv'd as
before, who, by a Law of the Conqueror, were
prohibited Intercourse with the Saxons) must
die with the People; and a new one, namely the
Saxon, be introduced in its stead?

I have many things to alledge in defence of
the Weakness and Inequality of this Perfor­
mance; as namely, its being collected at di­
vers times, and in haste, because of my other
more necessary Business; as also, its being prin­
ted from a foul Copy, and the like; which first
may have alter'd the Style, and the two last
let many things pass Muster, which, upon more
mature deliberation, would not: But I hope
the discreet Reader will pass by such Failures,
without carping at them (as considering that
no Man is infallible;) and as for the Igno­
rant and Envious, I value not their Censures;
but, with Martial, In invidum, count them un­
fit for Humane Society.



Qui ducis vultus, & non legis ista libenter,
Omnibus invideas, invide; nemo tibi.

I have nothing more to beg, but the kind
Reader's Charity for the Faults of the Press,
which, I hope, may consist chiefly in Literals,
and so may be the more easily mended with a
Pen; and that he would not be offended at the
unpleasantness of the Style, but rather consider
what the Subject will bear.



Rules whereby to know when a Word
is derived from the Latin, and
how it may be made Latin again;
composed to prevent the Book's
growing to too great a Bulk.

1. MOst Words in English, ending in nee, or
cy, are derived from the Latin,
ending in tia; as, Temperantia, Clementia; Tem­
perance, Clemency, &c.

2. Words ending in ion in English, are made Latin by­
casting away n; as, Question, Quaestio;
Religion, Religio, &c.

3. Words ending in ty, are made Latin, by
changing ty into tas; as, Liberty, Libertas;
Charity, Charitas, &c.

4. Words ending in ude, are derived from the
Latin, by changing o into e; as, Fortitude, For­
titudo; Gratitude, Gratitudo, &c.

5. Words ending in d, denoting the order
or manner of a thing, the said Words being Ad­
jectives, are made Latin, by adding us; as Ri­
gid, Putrid; Rigidus, Putridus, &c.



6. Words having t, n, or r, in the end, be­
tween two Vowels, are made Latin, by changing
the last Vowel into us, being Adjectives; as,
Mute, Obscene, Obscure; Mutus, Obscœnus, Ob­
scurus.

 7. Most Words ending in nt, are made Latin,
by changing nt into ns; as, Latent, Latens;
Vigilant, Vigilans, &c.

8. Many English Words ending in al, by ad­
ding is, are made Latin Adjectives; as, Liberal,
Liberalis; Substantial, Substantialis, &c.

THE 
ETYMOLOGY 
OF THE 
English Tongue.

A
A, is a Vowel that is often
superfluous in the be­
ginning of words; as in
Arise, abide, abate, &c.

Abaisance; which we falsly write
Obeisance, as if it came from the French Obeisance, when
really it comes from Abbaisser,
which signifies, to depress, or make an humble inclination
of the body; as we do, when
we do Abaisance.

Abandon, from the
French Abandonner,
or the Ital. Abandonare;
if it may not better,
and likelier be drawn from the
Anglo-saxonick Abannan,
that is, publickly to dis-inhe­
rit: Or, which is most likely,
from our own word Bann,
or the Belgick Bannen, that
is, to lie under a Curse, the A
Otiosa, or superfluous, being
added.

Abase, from the Fr. Abbaisser,
the Ital. Abbassare, or the
Span. Abaxar; to lessen, to
keep under.

Abash, from the Fr. Esbahir, to
affrighten; which comes from
the Lat. Expaveo: If it
be not likelier from the Spanish
Abaxar, to keep under; be­
cause Inferiours are usually
abash'd, when suddainly ac­
costed by Superiors.

Abate, from the Fr. Abbattre, abatre,
the Ital. Abattere, or
the Spanish Abatir; which in
one sence, signifie, to beat down; in another, to sub­
stract, as in Arithmetick. The reverend Dr. Honywood de­
rives it from the Privative A,



and the Belgick Baete; which
signifies Profit, or Interest;
because by diminishing a thing,
it becomes less profitable. Let
the Curious judge, which is best to follow. 

Abbot, Anglo-saxonick Abbud,
abbod, and abbad, Belg. Abd,
abt, Teutonick Abt, Fr. Abbe,
Ital. Abbate, Spanish Abad,
Lat. Abbas. It may seem to
be deduced from the Heb. Ab,
or Syr. Abba, Father; which
an Abbot properly is: But, to be sure, we have it, by a small
corruption, from the English-­
Saxon Abbod, which signifies
the same.

Abbridge, from the Fr. Abbreger,
and that from the Lat.
Abbreviare, to curtail, or
make shorter.

Abet, which, I think,
may not incommodiously
come from the Lat. Præp. Ad to, and bet;
which, in composition, signi­
fies, to stand by one, or
bet on ones side; and therefore
should seem to be right spell'd
Abbet; If it may not be de­
duced from a priv. and the
Belg. Barten, to profit.

Abide, from the AS. Abidan,
Bidan, Belg. Beyden, Ital.
Badare, to subsist, stay, or
tarry; which may all of them,
perhaps, come from the AS.
Byan, to inhabit, or dwell.
The word metaphorically sig­
nifies, to endure or suffer any
hardship.

Above, from the AS. Bufan,
Belg. Boven, and the super­
fluous, particle a, and both
again from the AS. Ufan.

About, from the AS. Abutan,
which is compounded of ab,
from, and utan, without,
abroad, the last, or extremi­
ty; from whence comes the Belg. Buyten, which signifies
the same.

Abroad, from the superfluous Par­
ticle a, and broad: which see.

Abstain, from the
Teut. Abstehen, Belg. Af-stain; which
signifie; to stand off from: If
it may not more commodi­
ously be drawn from the Lat.
Abstineo; which I incline to.

Abuct, from the Fr. Aboutir;
which signifies, to oppose, or
confront.

Accompany, v. Company,

Accomplish, from the Fr. Accom­
plir, Ital. Accompire; if it
may not be better done from the Decomposit Lat. Adcom­
plere, thoroughly to finish.

Accompt, or Account, from the
Fr. Accompter, or the Lat.
Adcomputare. 

Accord, from the Fr. Accorder,
the Ital. and Spanish Noun
Accordo, the Lat. Accordare;
which all signifie, to agree, or
consent: But I think it is bet­
ter deduced from the Lat.
Praep. ad, and Chorda, the
string of a musical Instru­
ment, because they ought to
agree or accord in harmony:



And this is easily done, by ta­
king away h in chorda, and
changing ad into ac, as is fre­
quent in Composition. Hence
come our According, and Ac­
cordingly. 

Accost, from the Fr. Accoster,
Ital. Accostare, to draw near
one: It may not inelegantly be fetch'd from the Lat. præp.
Ad, and Costa a rib; which,
by a Synecdoche partis pro to­
to, may signifie the whole
side; as Wrestlers do accost
one another, by joining side
to side.

Account, from the obsolete Fr.
Acconter, the Ital. Accontare,
to tell, declare, or shew. See
Accompt, and Recount.

Accouter, from the Fr. Accou­
trer, to cloath, or apparel; q.
d. Lat. Adconsutare, to tack
on together.

Accrew, from the Fr. Noun Ac­
crue, an increase, or addition; 
if you cannot, by the help of
a figure or two, deduce it
from the Lat. Accrescere, to
abound, or increase.

Accurse, v. Curse.

Accustom, v. Custom.

Ace, from the Fr.
Az; if you cannot draw it from the barbarous Greek Ἀζὰς,
which signifies a
Dy.

Ach, Ake. 
from the AS. Ace,
Ece, grief, or pain; which
may be easily derived from
ἂχος, that signifies the same
thing. I think it may most
truly be drawn from the
Ache bone, that part being ve­
ry much subject to a distem­
per called Ischias, or Hip-­
Gout; which we corruptly
enough call Sciatica.

Acknowledge, from the præp.
Ad, the AS. Cnaw, a con­
tract of Cnawan, to know,
or Knowledge it self, and Le­
gan, to put; that is, to put into my knowledge or under­
standing.

Acorn, from the AS. Aac, an
Oak, and Cern, grane, or fruit; from whence flow the
Belg. Aker, Aecker, Eeckel;
and the Teut. Eychel, Ecker,
which all signifie
an Acorn.

Acquaint, from the Fr. Accoin­
ter, to acquire one's friend­
ship.

Acquest, profit, or gain; from
the Fr. Acquest, the Ital. Ac­
quisto, and all of them from the Lat. Acquisitum, ab Ac­
quiro. 

Acquit, to absolve, or free; from
the Fr. Acquitter, q.d.  Lat.
Adquietare, to make quiet:
So our Aquittance, from Ital.
Acquittanza, q.d.  Adquie­
tantia, or a quieting.

Adamant, from the Greek  Ἀδά­
μας, which comes from the
Privative α and δαμάω, to
tame, by reason of its insupe­
rable hardness.

Adder, from the AS. Aetter,
Belg. Adder, Teut. Matter, C.
Br. Meidr, Dan Eder; which
all signifie the same thing.



An Addle Egg AS. Adel, a
disease, Adlian, to be sick,
q.d.  a sick, or rotten Egg.

Address, Fr. Addresser, Ital. Ad­
drizzare, q.d.  Lat.
Addire­
ctare; because all our prayers and arguments are directed to
some particular thing or per­
son.

Adieu, Fr. Adieu, Ital. Adio,
Hisp. Adios, farewel: q.d.  
Ad Deum te commendo, I
commend you to God.

Adjourn, from the Præp. Ad, and
the Fr. Jour, the Ital. Giorno,
a day; which, not unlikely, comes from the Lat. Diur­
num, daily.

Adjoining, from the Fr. Adjoin­
dre, Lat. Adjungere, to join
to.

Adjudge, v. Iudge.

Adjust or Make even Accounts; 
from the Fr. Adjuster, to ac­
commodate, or fit to; q.d.  
Lat. Adjustare, to make even
Accounts.

Admiral, from the Arabick E­
mir, a Lord, or Commander,
and the Greek ἃλιος, belong­
ing to the Sea; q.d.  Prince
of the Sea: It may, not un­
likely, be drawn from the Teut. Ampt, meir, al; Office,
Sea, whole; q.d.  one that hath
the sole Command of the Sea. Minsevus takes it from Aen,
meer al; above, Sea, the whole;
q.d.  over the whole Sea.

Ado. with much ado; from the
Verb do. or act, and the ini­
tial Particle A. 

Advance, Fr. Avancer, Ital. A­
vanzare, to move profit, or
go forward; from ab and an­
te; i.e.  from what one was
before; q.d.  from an inferior
degree to an higher.

Advantage, from the Fr. Avan­
tage, profit, or help.

To adventure, q.d.  Lat. Adven­
turare; as Adventura, or E­
ventura, understand Fortuna, or
Hora. 

Advertise, from the Lat. Adver­
tere, to admonish, teach tho­
roughly, or make sure of.

Advice, or Advise, from the Fr.
Advis, or the Ital. Aviso,
Counsel, or Opinion.

Affair, from the Fr. Affaire, Ital.
Affare, a business, or employ;
q.d.  Lat. Adfacere, tied to do
a thing that lies upon me to
be done.

Affiance, from the Fr. Affiance,
faith, or trust.

Afford, from the Teut. Furdern,
Fordern: It may be also
brought from the Particle
A, or rather, the Præp. Ad,
and the AS. Bord, a table;
q.d.  to allow victuals for the
table.

Affraid, or Afraid, from the Fr.
Effrayer, Effroyer, to scare,
or terrifie. I could willingly
deduce it from the Lat. Præp.
Ad, and our English word
Fear, or Fear'd. 

Affranchise, v. Enfranchise.

Affright, from our initial Par­
ticle A, and Fright; which
see.



Affront, Fr. Affront, Ital. Af­
fronto, Hisp. Afrenta, all sig­
nifying the same thing; as if one
should say in Lat. Adfrontare,
i.e.  set front against front, or
oppose one to the face.

Afore, v. Before.

Afresh, from the initial A, and
Fresh; which see.

Aft, and Abaft, Sea-terms, from
the AS. Aeftan, behind, or
after; that is, the hinder part
of the Ship. Somnerus useth
the word Baeftan in the
same sence; a contract, as I
suppose, of Abaeftan, to
which, by taking of the two
last Letters, we owe the Ori­
ginal of our
Abaft.

After, from the AS. Eft,
Aefter, Aeftan, after;
Belg. Achter, after; Run and
Dan. Efter, the ancient Teut.
After. Dr. Mer. Cas. ingeni­
ously fetches it from the Greek
Ἀυτὰρ, Caeterùm. 

Again, from the AS. Agen,
again; and both ours and the AS. from the AS. Eac, or
Aec, again, and Ana, toge­
ther, q.d.  one after another immediately.

Against, from the AS. Agen,
Ogen, opposite to.

Agast, from the superfluous Par­
ticle A, and the AS. Gast,
a Spirit, Spectre, or Shadow;
q.d.  frighted with the sight of
some, Spectre, or Ghost. It may not unlikely be drawn
from the Gr. Ἀγάω, Ἀγάζ­
μαι, to wonder with horrour.

Agate-stone, from the Gr. Ἀχά­
τυς.

Agnail: Somnerus does ingeni­
ously derive it from the AS. Ange, vexed, and Naegle,
a Nail; q.d.  a pained Nail. It may very well be drawn from
Ad to, and our English Nail,
because it grows by the nails
of one's feet; q.d.  a nail to a
nail.

Ago, as we say, long ago, is ma­
nifestly derived from A, and
go; which see. There is an
AS. word, which signifies, By-past, viz.  Agan,, from
which it possibly may come.

Agony, from the Gr. Ἀγωνία,
whose root signifies, a stri­
ving, or conflict, as people in
an Agony have.

Agree, from the Fr. Aggreer;
but I think, more likely from the Lat. Ad and Gratum; q.
d. grateful, or acceptable to.

Aggrieve, v. Grieve.

Ague, from the Fr. Aigu, sharp;
because an Ague, at least, in
the Paroxism, is sharp.

Ah, from the Lat. Oh; or, as all
other Interjections, from the
sound that by natural instinct,
one in misery puts forth.

Aid, from the Fr.
Aider, Ital. Aiutare, and both of
them from the Lat. Adjutare, to help.

Aim, from the Fr. Esme,
a scope, or mark; though not unlike­
ly, from the Lat. Aestimare,


 
i.e.  diligently to take heed,

were, and of what Country:
to whom 'twas answer'd, they
were Angli or English-men:
Imo potius Angeli Yea rather

with Anticks, Sculptum figu­

ticks, Choreas ducere Anti­
quo more.

ease that only infests the heart,

cardiacus.

same.

haps from the Fr. G. Andouil­
lers; that is, the first knags
or branches in the horns of a

whence, I suppose, proceeds

thinks it rather comes from the
AS. Hereberga, Belg.

drawn from the AS. Bælig,
a purse or satchel, from the ga­
thering the mouth when they
shut.

Balloon, from the Fr. G. Ballon,
Ital. Ballone; q.d.  a great

London: Either from the AS. Abunden, ready; and this
from Bindan, to bind, by a
Metaphor taken from Sol­
diers; who, when they are
in readiness to march, do truss
up bag and baggage: Or
from the other Bound, by a
Metaphor taken from Sailers;
who bind themselves, not to de­
sert one another in any danger.

Bounds, corrupted, 'tis like,


 
from the Fr. G. Bornes, id.
this perhaps from the AS. Fo­
ran, before; and therefore
are called Frontiers, or fore­
parts of a country, or field. 

Bounty, from the Fr. G. Bonté,
goodness; of which it is an
effect.

Bourn, from the AS. Burn,
Belg. Borne, Teut. Brunn, a
well, or spring; which Fr.
Jun. derives from the Gr.
Βρύω, to spring forth.

Bouts, many Bouts, from the
AS. Beaten, to beat, Ital.
Botta, Fr. G. Coup, a box on
the ear; this from the Lat. Colaphus,  idem; and all of
them from the Gr. Κολάπτω,
to hurt.

Bow, from the AS. Bugan,
Belg. Buygen, Teut. Beugen,
to bend.

A Bow, from the AS. Boga,
Belg. Boge, Teut. Bogen,
Dan. Bue, the same; all from
our word Bow. Mer. Cas. de­
rives it from the Gr. Βιὸς, a
bow, or arch.

Bowel, from the Fr. G. Bouyau,
idem; perhaps from the Lat.
Bottulus; as we say, Pud­
dings.

Bower, an anchor amongst Ma­
riners, which a ship carrieth
often times to the Bow of the
ship, and from thence takes
its name.

Bower, from the AS. Bur, a
parlour. Minsevus derives it
from the Norm. Bough. I had
rather draw it from our word
Bow, because it is built with
crooked wood. Fr. Jun.
draws it from the Gr. Βύριος,
an house, or mansion.

A Bowge of Court, a quantity of
provision allowed by the King
to his servants, beyond their
ordinary pay; from the Fr.
G. Bouge; this from the Lat.
Bulga, a Portmanteau. The
learned Th. H. draws it from
Bouche, a mouth; as they call
one maintained at the King's
cost, Il a Bouche en Cour;
(i.e.) he hath his mouth in
the Court.

Bowl, as Menagius writes, from
the Lat. Bulla, or Bolus, Gr.
Βῶλοσ, a round clod.

A Bowl to drink in, from the
AS. Bolla, idem. I had
rather draw it from the
Lat. Bulla, a round boss, or
knob in harness for horses;
because Bowls, especially,
those of any bigness, do gra­
dually, from their basis, branch
into a round figure.

To Bowlt a Coney, a term in
hunting; from the Fr. G.
Bouter, and this from the Lat.
frequentative Pultare, to beat
hard; q.d.  to knock her out
of her hole.

Bowse; Vossius draws it from
the Gr. Βύζω, to fill. If
I were Grecian enough, I
should think it came from
Φυσάω, to blow short; be­
cause he that drinks greedily,
puts himself out of breath.



A Bourser of a College, from
the Fr. G. Boursier, this from
Bourse, a Purse; q.d.  Pur­
ser, or Treasurer.

Bow-sprit, or Bolt-sprit, from
our word, Bolt, and the
Belg. Spriet, the Sail-yard.

The Bowt of the knee, from the
Teut. Bug, the hamm; and
this again from Beugen, to
bow, or bend.

Bowyer, from the Dan. Boyert,
a swift Bark; perhaps so cal­
led, from its being easily vee­
red about, which way the
Boat-swain or Pilate pleases.

Box on the ear: Minshew in­
geniously derives it from the
Gr. Adverb Πὺζ or, it being
very probably of a German
original, from the Teut. Po­
chen, to strike, or smite.

Box, from the AS. Boxe, Teut.
Buchs; all from the Lat. Bu­
xus, a Box-tree; by the Sa­
xons, Boxtreow.

Boy, possibly from the Gr. Βαι­
ύς, little; though Minsevus
his derivation hereof from the
Teut. Bub, or Bube, is most
probable: Yet Minsevus, upon
second thoughts, appositely e­
nough, derives it from the Heb.
Bob, a babe, or young child.

The Boy of an Anchor: Dr. Th.
H. does ingeniously draw it
from the Fr. G. Bois, wood;
q.d.  a piece of wood fastned
to the Anchor, and floating above water.

Brabble, from the Belg. Brabbe­
len, to scold: But it may be
more safely drawn from the
Lat. rec. Parabolare, to con­
tend in words.

Brace, a term in Architecture;
from the Fr. G. Embrasser;
or, which is all one, from
Bras, Lat. Brachium, a
cramp-iron to hook square
stones together withal.

Brace, two, or a couple; from
the Fr. G. Embrasser, to em­
brace: Hence, To Brace, or
couple two dogs in one collar.

Bracelet, from the Lat. Bra­
chium; sometimes, though
seldom, read Brachiale, an arm,
upon which a bracelet is put.

A Brache, a word found in Flo­
rius; perhaps from the Gr. v.
Βράχω, to sound or resound;
a kind of Hound of a strong cry, so called.

Brackan, or Fern, from our
own word Break; because, be­
ing brittle, it is easily broken.

Bracket, or Braget, a term in
Architecture; if I be not mis­
taken, from the Ital. Braciet­
to, signifying, a little crotchet,
or cramping-iron.

Brackets, a word used by Mari­
ners; from the same root.

Brackish, or salted; from the
Teut. Brechen, to vomit; for
salt water provoketh vomiting

Bragg, from the Fr. G. Braguer,
to go stately, or proudly;
and this manifestly from the
Lat. Paratus, ready, or fit;
for Braggadocio's consider
what they are to speak, or act


 
before-hand, lest they should be
trepann'd. 

Bragget, a sort of Hydromel;
from the C. Br. Brag, Malt,
and Goes, an honey-comb.

To Braid, or Bread hair, from
the Belg. Breyden, to weave
together.

both from the Gr. Βρέγμα, which
signifies, the fore part of the
head, where the brains lie.

or the Belg. Braeck, a wooden
instrument to break Flax
withal.

mel, Bræmbel, Brem­
bel, Bremble, vexing;
because, tearing the hands,
&c. with its sharp prickles, it
causes pain, or vexation.

called, from Bramble, in
which it builds its nest.

Brancher, a term in Hawking;
from the Fr. G. Branchier, a
young hawk, a creature much
frequenting the boughs of
trees.

Branch, from the Fr. G. Branche,
this from the Lat. Branca;
which, before the declining
state of the Empire, signified
the same.

Brand, or Fire-Brand, from the
AS. Brand, Belg. Branden,
to burn; from hence, Brand,
a mark set upon cattel by the
owner. But our word Brand-­
new, seemeth, by an elegant
Trope, to be taken from the
Smith's craft, being derived
from Brand, and New; q.d.  
just new out of the fire.

Brande-wine, from the Belg.
Brande-wiin, burnt wine. V.
Brand, and Wine.

Brandish, from the Fr. G. Bran­
dir, to glister as a Sword does
in wielding; and so may, not
unlikely, be drawn from our
word Brand. 

Brandling, a small worm to fish
with; from the Fr. G. Bran­
diller, to wag, or move this
way and that way.

Brangle, from the Teut. Balgen,

gen, to be insolent, Bravo-like,
such people not easily suffer­
ing an affront.

Ital. Brenna, C. Br. Brann,
the same. Mer. Cas. derives

A Brat, one come of an ob­
scure parentage, a bastard;
from the Belg. Fradde, a boy;
both, without any offence, from the AS. Bredan, to
bring up. V. Breed, and
Brood.

Bratt, a rag put before one;
from the AS. Bratt, course
cloth; this from Brittan,
to break; because it is a ro­
ten remnant of cloth. V.

Ital. Bravo, stout, magnani­
mous. It may also seem to be
derived from the Gr. Βραβεὺς,
a Victor.

to low as an Ox; but rather
from our Eng. Bawl, by an
interposition of the letter r.

Brawn: the learned G. Rogers,
M. D. G. M. L. S. derives it
from the Lat. Aprugna, sig­
nifying the same; yet I had
rather derive it from the AS.
Bar, a
Boar, and Run, a

ned.

sel, and Βρώσκω, to feed up­
on.

It may, not unlikely, be deri­
ved from the Gr. Βράκω, to

the same. It may likewise be
drawn from the Gr. Ροθος,
Æol. Βρόθος, force, or noise;
for the breath, being stopped,

ce, Belg. Broecke, the same:
From hence perhaps the word
Breech, if not more commo­
diously from the AS. Bryce,
a rupture, or parting asun­
der.

Belg. Broeden, Teut. Bruten,

Fr. Jun. draws it from the C.
Br. Briwbara, crusts, or mor­

same. Menagius draws it
from the Lat. Imbrex, a roof-­

Belg. Bruyd, Teut. Braut,
idem; and all of them from
the AS. Bredan, Teut. Bru­
ten, Belg. Broeden, to keep
warm, or cherish.

Bridegroom, most manifestly
from Bride, and Groom; be­
cause the man is, as it were,
groom, or servant to his bride
on the day of marriage.

Bridge, from the AS. Brigge,
and this from the AS. Ober,
above, and Rige, a back:
Or rather, q.d.  Ober-ig;

Fr. G. Brize, Hisp. Brise, a
chill wind. It also alludes to
the Gr. Φρίκη, a trembling, or

fight; i.e.  a band of war-like
men.

Brigandine, from the Fr. G. Bri­
gantin, Ital. Brigantino, id.
perhaps from the Fr. G. Bri­
gand, a robber; because Pi­
rates were wont to make use
of these ships, for their conve­
niency. But you will say,
Whence cometh Brigand?
Faucherus draws it from the
Germ. Brig, a bridge, or
Brug; because robbers sieze
travellers upon bridges. Ni­
cot. thinks it so called from the
Teut. Berg, a mountain, and
Gehen, to go; q.d.  one that
goes among mountains to hide
himself.


 
Bright, from the AS. Beorht,
idem. Fr. Jun. supposeth it to
come from the C. Br. Brith,

ding the diminutive termina­
tion ket. v. Brest.

our word Burst, because a
bristle bursteth or breaketh
through the skin.

Brittle, from the AS. Brytan,
Fr. Th. Brettan, Brittan, Dan.
Bryder, to break asunder. Fr.
Jun. derives them all from the
Gr. Βρτὸς, frail, or mortal.
Minsevus writeth it Brickle,
from the word Break; which
I cannot so well approve of.

Broach, from the Fr. G. Broche,
Ital. Broccia, a spit; hence
we say, Broach a vessel, meta­
phorically.

Broad, from the AS. Brad,
Belg. Breyd, Teut. Breit, the
same.

Broccado; or rather, Brocado; 
a word purely Spanish, but
frequently read in the English
Translation of Mandeslous;
from the Ital. Brocca, a stud,
or boss; q.d.  cloth of gold
and silver.

Brock, from the AS. Broc,
Ital. Burcho, Buchio, the
same; or rather, from the

our saying, He bites like a
Badger.

Brocket, from the Fr. G. Bro­
cart, and both of them from
the Fr. G. Broche, in our lin­
gua, A Broach, q.d.  a stag of
two years old, having horns
without knags, like the end of
a spit, or broach.

To Broggle for Eels, a saying
among Fisher-men; from the
Fr. G. Brouiller, to trouble
the water; because by so do­
ing, they are more easily ta­
ken.



Broil, from the same root; if
not more properly from the
Ital. Broglio, for Imbroglio;
(i.e.) to canvass.

Broker, from the word Break;
because Bankrupts only were,
in former ages, permitted to
be of this trade. It may as
well be a contraction only of
the word Procurer. 

Brood, from the AS. Bredan,
Teut. Bruten, Belg. Broeden,
Brueden, to sit upon eggs:
It alludes to the Gr. Βρύω, to
grow big with young.

tiently, by inverting the sence
a little, from the AS. Bru­

ver, is derived from Βροchi;ὴ, a
shower. Mer. Cas. derives it
from the Æol. Βρὺαζ, for
Ῥύαζ, a river. Dr. Th. H.
draws the AS. Broca, a ri­
ver, from Breacan, to break;
because, upon rain, they break
over their banks.

or sore; from the word
Break.

a report; this perhaps from
the Lat. Furere, to be in a

day; from the Teut. and Belg.
Brunst; (i.e.) the Heat of the

and Wood q.d.  young small
sprigs, in comparison, like to
Swines bristles.

Dan. Boble, the same; per­
haps corrupted from the Lat.

Buckler, from the Fr. G. Bou­
cler, Ital. Boccoliero, Fr. Th.
Bukelere, a target like an half
moon; which Fr. Jun. de­
rives from the Belg. Bocken-­
Leer, a Goat's skin. I suppose
rather that it comes from the
word Buckle. 

Buckram, from the Fr. G. Bourgram,
Ital. Bucherame, the
same: Once it signified a very
thin sort of Linen and wool­
len cloth; in which sence we
may draw it from the Fr. G.
Bourre, a lock of wool, and
Grain. v. Grogram.

Bud, from the Fr. G. Bouter,

gius draws from the Lat. fre­

Italians, Buffale, much wore
by officers in an army.

Buffet, from the Fr. G. Buffe,
Ital. Buffetto, Hisp. Bofeton,
the same.

Buffet-stool; I suppose it may
come from the Fr. G. Buffet,
a table; because it might serve
for a little table, it being made
after the fashion of a table.

To Buffle, or Muffle, from the
AS. Abyffan, to mumble;
Belg. Baffen, to bark; per­
haps all of them feigned from
the sound.

Buffle, from the Dan. Byffel,
Fr. G. Beuffle, Ital. Buffalo;
they all signifie a kind of wild
Ox: From hence, A Buffle-­

may call one, that hath a great
head and little wit.

Buffoon, from the Fr. G. Buf­
fon, Ital. Buffone, a talkative,
prating fellow. Salmasius
draws it from the Lat. Bufo, a
Toad; because such a person
swells like a Toad, when irri­
tated.

Bugg or Bugbear, v. Big. Dr.
Th. H. derives it from Pug,
or Pucke, a Devil V. Pug.

Bugg, for Big; as when 'tis said,
He looks very Bug of it. V.

being in the Teut. primarily
called Blutfinck. 

Bulk, from the AS. Buce, Dan.

See Frank and Free in the 
Com. Names. According 
to the same Jun. they were

mer Derivation is far better.

sire. Geren may have its

a Stone, it denoting a Stone 
of refuge.

because Hercules ever arriv'd 
at this place, for he ne'r came

Port; Adr. Jun. a Citizen, 
and the Glory thereof, sup­
poseth that it is so called 
from a great Inn in the Mar­
ket-Place, having the Horn 
for a Sign; or because their 
Coat of Arms had upon it 
the figure of an Horn. 

Horn Church in Essex, formerly

Hold, or he that is set over 
the Ward or Watch: Or

may be drawn from the AS. 
Hold, Hospitality, & Ward, 
q.d.  kind to Strangers: 
or it is so call'd q. Here­
ward, the Keeper, or Pillar 
of an Army. It may also be 
taken from the Teut. Hoch,

der, as Camden has it; or 
from the old Teut. Hold,

saith Kilian. 

Howburn, in Scotland, from

high. It answers the Latin 
Celsus.

vour; It answers our word 
Grace, a Christen-Name, 
frequently given to Women. 

Huldericus, if it be not the 
same with Ilderic, or Hil­
deric, which see, I may draw 
it from the Teut. Hulden, to 
honour one with his Vote, 
and Ric, Rich, q.d.  such an 
one whose Vote will go far 
in ones favour. 

Hulet, a Sirname, from the 
Fr. G. Houlette, a Shepherd's 
Crook.

that famous Fortification in 
Yorkshire, formerly called 
Kingston upon Hull, takes 
its name; because it is situ­
ate upon the mouth of this 
River, where it disembogueth 
it self into Abus or Humber. 
It may be drawn from the 
Teut. Heulen, Belg. Huylen, 
to howl, from the noise it 
maketh when it meets with 
the Sea. 

Hulsok, a Sirname, q. d. the 
Son of Vlric, or Huldric.  

Humber, a famous River where 
the Tide cometh at fixed 
times, as in the Thames, by 
Ptolemy call'd Abus, in the AS. 
Humbre, Humbre Ea, 
the water Humber, not from 
Humber a King slain there, 
as is commonly believed, but 
as Somnerus hath it, from 
Humming, because the wa­
ters thereof make a great 
huzzing at the flowing and 
ebbing of the Tide. Leland 
taketh it to be a Contract of 
Humm, and Aber, which in 
the C. Br. signifieth the mouth 
of a River. 

Humbert, the last Prince of 
Vienna Narbonensis; Kilian 
exp. it Vnwert, (i. e.) not 
dear. I would rather draw 
it from our word Home,

famous, q.d.  one that is mag­
nificent at Home, or that 
liveth sumptuously, or keeps

tofore Ingleford, perhaps so 
called, quasi Engla-ford,

Hunsden, in Herefordsh. possi­
bly from the AS. Hunde, a

sorted to hunt.

where Huntersdune, (i.e.) 
the Mount of Hunters; for­

Arnulphs bury, from Ar­
nulph, an Holy man that 
was there interr'd. 

Hurn or Hyrn, a Sirname; 
Ælfricus exp. it a Corner. It 
may be deriv'd from the AS. 
Hyrn, horn, for a Corner 
is generally crooked like a 
Horn. 

Hurst, or Hyrst, a Sirname, 
also the name of a Castle. 
Camden interpreteth it a 
Wood. It may be derived 
from the AS. Hyrsta, Horse

which as Camden saith, sig­
nifies a Wood, and Leag, 
with us a Lea, or Ley, a

from the Lat. Jacobus, 
yet more immediatly 
corrupted from the Hisp. Jayme, or the It. Gia­

the Hebrew Name Iacob im­
plying a Supplanter, because 
Jacob cunningly deceived 
his Brother. 

Iane, a Christen-Name of a 
Woman, in the Fr. G. Geanne, 
a corruption of Ioan, which 
see in its place, if it may not 
rather come of the Lat. 
Jana, answering the Man's 
Name Janus.  

Iasper, or Gaspar, a Christen-­
Name, the Name of one of 
the Wise men that came to 
worship our Saviour, (if we 
may credit Chronology) and 
if so, it must needs be of an 
Arab. Original , for the Wise 
men are thought to have 
come out of Arabia. 

Iceni, a People of Brit. from 
the C. Br. Iken, a Wedge, for 
this Region is extended to­
ward the Ocean in the form 
of a Wedge. This People 
had in Possession the Coun­
tries of Suffolk, Norfolk, Cam­
bridge, and Huntingdon. 

Long Iehindon, in Warw. for­
merly Vchindon, not unlikely 
 

 
from the AS. Wyc,

from the Lat. Judæus, the 
same. 

Iewry, Palaestina, Judæa, or the Holy Land; and in a 
Secondary sence, a Street in 
London, where the Jews dwelt 
together formerly. There 
is found in an ancient Tran­
slation of the French Bible 
Iuerie, of the very same 
sence, so that it is thought, 
that, He, whom we call a 
Iew, was heretofore in the 
Fr. G. called un Jüe, though 
at this day both the words 
are out of use, and Juif is 
written in the room of the 
word Jüe.

Temple of Jie, an Irish Saint 
so called.

Nenn. call'd Pont-Ivel-Coit, that is to say, Ivel Bridge in the Wood. 

Ildericus, the last King but ­
one of the Vandals of Africa. 
Adr. Jun. derives it from the 
Belg. Elder, or Ilder, an 
Udder, and Ric, Rich, that 
is, rich in Cattle. But if his 
right Name was Hilderic, as 
some write it, I had rather 
draw it from Held, a Noble­
man, and the AS. Ric, Rich, 
that is, one that had many 
Nobles within his Kingdom. 

Ildobaldus, a King of the 
Ostro-Gothi of Italy, not un­

lemy call'd Olicana, by adding

in the C. Br. it sign. Guith, 
a Separation, for it is thought 
to have been parted from

land, by Ptolem. Isanium, from

cingafeld, (i.e.) the Ur­
chins Field; see Vrchin 
and Field in the Common 
Names. 

Ireland, by the Natives call'd 
Erin, by Orpheus, Aristotle, 
and Claudian, Jerne; by Eusta­
thius, Οὐερνία, in the C. Br. 
Yverden, from the Hib. Hiere, 
the West, for it is the far­
thest West of any Isle in 
Europe, and ought rather to 
be call'd Iberia or Hesperia, 
from Hesperus the Evening 
Star rising in the West. Wa­
raeus draws it from the Iberi, 
the first Inhabitants thereof. 
Bochartus from the Phœnic. 
Ibernae, (i.e.) the uttermost 
Habitation. 

Irmenseal, the God of the 
ancient Germans; in Versteg. 
Ermensewl. Jun. will have 
it to be written Hermonstal, 
from the Teut. Herr, Belg. 
Heer, a Lord, Mon the 
Moon, and Stal, a Stall, or 
Seat. Verstegan, who makes 
him the same with the Mer­
cury of the Romans, derives 
the Name better from the 
Teut. Armen, Poor men, 
 

 
and Seale, a Pillar, (i.e.) the 
Pillar, or refuge for the Poor. 
Spelman likewise supposeth 
that it should rather be call'd

that is Mercury, and the same 
Seale, a Pillar, or Statue.  

Isabel, a Christen-Name of a 
Woman, by the Spaniards

Iisen, Iron, and the old

the River Isel, (which Jun.

of Germany, as Tacitus writes, 
from the Ger. Est, the East,

lington, perhaps from

adding the Term. ton, which

is derived from the Lat. 
Ocellum, by adding the AS.

comes from Ea, water, i.e.  
an Isle, or Land lying next 
to the Water. 

Kemp, a Sirname, from the 
AS. Cempa, a Souldier. 

Kenard, a Christen-Name, 
Cambd. derives it from Kind, 
and the Belg. Aerd, Nature. 
It may be better drawn from

and Aerd, Nature, i.e.  one 
acute and ingenious by Na­
ture: See Keen in the Com. 
Names. 

Kenchester, in the County of

teth not his Oath.

draws it from the Fr. G. Can­
ton, a corner, because Eng­
land, in this place stretcheth 
out it self in a corner toward

it is; that such a corner in

the Saxon so much ground 
in this place, as he could 
compass about with an Oxes 
Hide cut into as small 
Thongs as could be: Thong 
Castle.

rupted from the ancient

ly, because it lyeth in the

or from the Eng. to Melt,

for which Art perhaps it was 
heretofore accounted fa­

enough, if ever there was 
such a man, which I am not 
so apt to believe, by reason 
of the many fabulous Stories 
which are blown about con­
cerning him.

pounds it, Meerner des fri­
des, (i.e.) the Author of
