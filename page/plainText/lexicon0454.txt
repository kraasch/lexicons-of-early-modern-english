I have describ'd ,  as they are used there ;
But many words of art you still may seek,
The Miners Tearms are like to Heathen Greek,
Both strange and uncoth, if you some would see,
Read these rough verses here Compos'd by me.

BUnning's, Polings, Stemples, Forks, and Slyder,
Stoprice, Yokings, Soletrees, Roach, and Ryder,
Water holes, Wind holes, Veyns, Coe-shafts and Woughs,
Main Rakes, Cross Rakes, Brown-henns, Budles and Soughs,
Break-offs, and Buckers, Randum of the Rake,
Freeing, and Chasing of the Stole to th'Stake,
Starting of oar, Smilting, and driving drifts,
Primgaps, Roof works, Flar-works, Pipe-works, Shifts,
Cauke, Sparr, Lid-stones, Twitches, Daulings, and Pees,
Fell, Bous, and Knock-barke, Forstid-oar, and Tees,

This have I written for the miners sake,
That Miners are in Wirksworth Wapentake;
Perchance if these few lines accepted be,
An exposition may be made by me,
Of Mineral Tearms, to most men now abstruse,
Which by expounding may be of more use;
But for the present, I commit to view
This little book, the Mineral Law to shew;
