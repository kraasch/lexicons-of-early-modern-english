TO 
My Worthily, Honoured
FRIEND, 
Mr. FRANCIS ATKINSON.

I Shall not need to derive any confidence 
from the long acquaintance and friendship
hath passed between us, to presse you 
to the Patronage of this work, when 
there are so many other Considerations
that in a manner force it on you, as ha­
ving a certain right in it; it is the account of many a 
years Stewardship, the product of many a mid­
night thought, during my relation to you and 
those young Gentlemen committed by you to 
my charge and oversight, in a word, it had the 
first and last hand put to it, that is, ows both its
originall and perfection to your house at HAD­
LEY. There are indeed abroad in the world 
many books conducing to the improvement of 
youth in good Letters, whereof it may be said
of some, they are superfluous, of others they are
burthensome, and by multiplicity of instruction di­




stract the Learner. And this proceeds partly 
from an itch of reputation, which even those 
of that laborious, (nay, by many sleighted) pro­
fession are not free from, partly from the diffi­
culties that attend the education of youth, and 
partly from that generall humour, in most men
of discovering their invention in furnishing the 
world with something that is new, or their wit 
in reforming and advancing what had been done
by others. But for this of mine, you are not 
ignorant of the difficulty of the attempt, what a 
strange multitude of Authors I have been forced,
as it were to anatomise, and that I may say, 
without any great losse of Modesty, that there 
never came yet abroad so methodicall an Insti­
tution of ENGLISH POESIE. For you, 
who look on education through other prospe­
ctive glasses than those of necessity or advantage, 
know, that it requires a person of generous incli­
nations, that as an exrprest Architect, layes
the solid foundations of humane life, and un­
dertakes a businesse that hath the greatest influ­
ence on Policy, Morality, and Religion.

This once granted, no pains, no care, no vigi­
lancy can be too great that is spent upon the cul­
tivation of these noble plants, were there only 
this inducement that we should transmit them
such to posterity as that they may in them per­
ceive our care and tendernesse. Upon these



 
grounds did I enter into the present relation to 
you, which being, as I said, a stewardship, it is but 
just I should bring something to testifie my faith­
fulnesse. You know how beneficial this work
hath been where it was brought forth, and exer­
cised, and I leave it to you, either to communi­
cate it, or conceale it. If ever it come abroad 
into the world, I desire it may be under the con­
duct of your name, that, for your particular, it 
may be satisfied how much you have contributed
to the the Commonwealth of Learning, and, for 
mine be convinced, how conscientious I have 
been in the discharge of my duty, what great re­
spects I have for you, and how passionately desi­
rous I am to expresse my self,

Sir,
Your most affectionate Friend, 
and faithful Servant, 

Josua Poole.
 






To the hopeful young Gentlemen, his 
Schollers in that private School, at Hadley,
Kept in the house of Mr. Francis Atkinson.

SWeet impes of early hopes whose smiling brow
Beckens the cincture of the laureate bough,
Whose lips seem made, to tast no other spring,
Than that by which the Thespian virgins sing.

Whose sprightly face, and active eyes descry
The Muses in a rising majesty:
You that without th'edition of a book,
Can make men read a Poet in your look;
Whose downy plumes with happy augurie,
Presage betimes,nwhat the fledge soul will be.

For you (Ingenious spirits) thus I trie
To find a milkie way to Poesie,
That babes, as they the coral nipples lugge,
May find an Hippocrene within the dugge,
And the first milk that they shall feed upon,
May be the sacred dew of Helicon,
And when at first their steps the earth shall greete,
At once may find their own and verses feete,
After as they grow up, Pegasus may
Be the first hobby-horse with which they play,
And when to higher sports they come, may put
An Homers Iliads in their game some nut,
And whilst they take their pastime in the sun,
Together make their tops and verses run,
Nay to that height they shall their phancies raise,
That whilst they run at, they shal win the Baies,
In all their sports they shall the Poets play,
And make the Birch, prevented by the Bay;




For they shal need no Masters to rehearse
Long tedious precepts of the lawes of verse,
In them so printed shall those lawes be seen,
As if they had the lawes of Nature been.
The only taske their Masters shall impose
On them, will be, to learn to speak in prose;
In which, they shall have, if they chance t'offend,
As boys scan, verses at their fingers ends,
Pleading like Ovid for to save their breech,
As if Prosodia went before In speech,
Or that they had into the world been brought,
As Lucan died, with verses in their throat,
Their cradles of the verdant laurel been,
Or of those learned trees which once were seene
After the Thracian Harper dance along,
Wedding their motions to his well-tim'd song,
And all that shal their sodain raptures hear,
That Poets are not made, but born will swear.
 
The early blossoms which I see in you,
Makes me believe these my presages true;
For, if you can so much already do;
What will they that may sooner come unto
Parnassus mount? If you so much can see
On plainer ground, what will they that shal be
Advantag'd by that hill, whose tops do rise
In stately height, to parly with the skies?
 
On then (sweet souls) that sacred verse may be
No longer call'd the thred-bare mystery;
Let the world see, what yet it scarce before
Hath known, there are good Poets, yet not poore,
Whose inspirations, and rich phancies be
More than a Taverns frothy tympany,
That conjure not up wit with spirit of wine,
Nor make the bay, supported by the vine;




Like those whose thirsty fancies ebbe and flow,
lust as their cups, greater or lesser grow,
Phæbus and Bacchus that together link,
And never write, but in or after drink:
As when great showers of rain fall from the skies,
In standing waters bubbles will arise.

And for my selfe (though I did ne'r bestride
The winged horse, and through the welkin glide,
Unto the forked hill; nor saw the spring,
Where those sweet maids of Memory do sing:
Whilst their harmonious aires give easie birth
Unto the flowers, and help the teeming earth:
Whilst shaggy Satyrs yeild their sences thrall
To the sweet cadence of their madrigals,
And all the leavy standards of the wood,
Quitting the place where they before had stood,
Came listning on, and every gladsome tree,
Link't with his neighbour to an unity,
Whisper their mutual joyes, till they had made
By their embrace, an unexpected shade,
And all the wing'd musitians of the aire,
Hid in their branches make a close repaire,
That by their tunes, they might learn how to sing,
And give a better welcome to the spring;
Whilst savage beasts, that thither too were come
Offerd themselves a thankful Hecatombe:
Though I dare not make title to that tree
That growes upon the banks of Castalie,
Nor on Parnassus top had ever Theam
Presented by the Muses in a dream,
Or with my teeth unbarkt the laurel graffe,
Yet) can I lend the weaker brains a staff
For their supportment, till their riper wit,
Shall laugh to see, they ever needed it,



 
Staffes cannot goe, and yet enable him
That wants assistance to his feeble limbe;
He that is lame, and cannot move, yet may
Lie still, and point to others out the way.
Many are dumb, and know not how to break
Their mind in words, yet by mute signes can speak,
And talk so with their fingers, that another
May give that language which their dumbnesse smothers.
Though whetstones cannot cut at all, they may
Do service, and make knives as sharp as they
Themselves are blunt, and they who cannot ring
By jangling may toll better ringers in,
Candles see nought themselves, yet lend a light,
VVhich in the dark gives others use of sight.
The height of my ambition and intent,
Is but to be a luckie instrument
For others good, and instruments we know,
Are usefull, though themselves can nothing do;
 
Accept and use then this my book, aspire
Unto the Mountains top, blow up that fire
VVhich yet is but a spark Prometheus stole
From Phebus wheels what burns within your soul,
Then give it vent, let it advance a flame,
VVhich may secure your and the Poets name,
From all the malice of invading time,
And conquer death with your victorious rime.

And though you may perchance meet some of those
That in a Satyr of their dough-bak'd Prose,
Not able to reach further, lash the horse,
They cannot sit, and whil'st they rudely force
Their waspish language to disgrace the fount,
The horse-hoof-made, scorning the sacred Mount,
Too high for them to climb, turn horse themselves,
And kick in vain, as waves against the shelves.
 



Crushing their froth, as dogs disturb the night
With fruitlesse howling at fair Cynthia's light,
Whilst she untroubled still along doth glide,
More by their barking envy glorifi'd,
In that bright Carre, their snarls cannot impeach,
As much above their malice as their reach:
Or like that fox, who long with greedy eyes,
Did on the grapy clusters tantalise,
And last contents himself to call them sower,
Which he perceiveth plac'd above his power,
And these may tell you that the Poets be,
But the fomenters of of obscenitie,
Of lust and lewdnesse, verse the Devils bait,
To draw youth on to what they else would hate.

Be not discourag'd, Muses none despise,
That ever gave the Graces Sacrifice;
Such Majesty is couch'd in numerous layes,
They never understood, which can dispraise.

'Tis true, some spend their ill-disposed hour,
Onely the Virgin Muses to deflowr,
And in loose language make the Graces be
Naked beyond the bounds of Modestie,
Who whilst with shamelesse ribaldry they sing,
Make Helicon a puddle for a spring,
Enough to make their reader, one would think,
With blushing change the colour of their ink:
But must we, cause some children idly play,
And cut their fingers, throw our knives away?
Or cause when once their bellies full, they eat
No more, but toy, must we forgoe our meat?
What if some looser dames to painting fall;
Shall chaster Matrons have no face at all?
If some for lust their gaudie garments wear,
Shall modest Virgins all their cloaths forswear?




If some by faggots ruine do conspire,
Must our cold chimney therefore want a fire?
And shall Lycurgus cut down every vine,
Because some Thraoians did exceed in wine?
Shall we all modest pictures quite decline,
For the lascivious draughts of Aretine?
If that abuse could take away the right,
And lawfull use, we scarce should use our sight.
Scripture may be abus'd, and best things may,
By the same argument, be cast away.
Though Caesar banish't Ovid far from Rome,
He kept Parthenious Virgil still at home.
All Poets are not vitious some there be,
Like Cato, verse it, yet with modesty,
And won to goodnesse, by their verse can show,
More souls than many prose-Divines can do;
Crown'd with religious bayes: for often those
Are chain'd by numbers that contemn loose prose,
And those whose souls are come so near the gall,
Of bitternesse, as to think stoicall
What speaks Religion, yet will dare to try
The Poets popular Divinity,
And with a yielding fancy lend an ear
To all that by the Poet preach't they hear.
Many have been, which Pulpits did eschew,
Converted from the Poets reading pew,
And those that seldome do salute the porch
Of Solomon, will come to Herberts Church;
For as that English Lyrick sweetly sings,
Whilst angels danc'd upon his trembling strings,
A verse may find him who a Sermon flies,
And turn delight into a sacrifice.
Then let the Poet use his lawfull bait,
To make men swallow what they else would hate,




Like wise Physicians that their pills infold
In sugar, paper, or the leaves of gold,
And by a vertuous fraud and honest stealth,
Cozen unwilling Patients into health;
Like winter fires, that with disdainfull heat,
The opposition of the cold defeat,
And in an angry Spleen do burn more fair,
The more encountered by the frosty air;
Let your Phebean fires its flame advance,
Blown by the cold breath of chill ignorance,
And like Amphion build a lofty rhyme,
That shall outlast the insolence of time,
For there is hidden in a Poets name.
A spell that can command the wings of fame,
And maugre all oblivions hated birth,
Begin your immortality on earth,
"And when more spreading titles are forgot,
"And spight of all their lead and searcloth rot,
"You wrapt and shrin'd in your own sheets shall lye
"As reliques fam'd for all posterity.
No envious time or age shall ever pierce,
The better marble of eternal verse,
Nine Muses can cammand the fatall three,
And make their baies out-live the Cypresse tree,
And though they part with breath they cannot die
Whose name's embalm'd in sacred Poesie,
For such are the proud miracles of verse,
They make men rise up from their drowsie herse,
And cause the grave deaths utmost spite but be
A larger womb to immortality.
The Deities above, and those below,
To the learn'd nine auspcious homage ow,
And they whose heads the lawrel chaplets bear
Can charm the gods in either Hemisphere.




What is't the Muses javelin cannot pierce?
When heaven and hell are master'd by a verse,
The Laurel staffe sway'd by a learned hand
Carries more magick than that silver wand,
Heavens verger waves, then that Medea shook,
When Aeson from the scalding bath she took,
Hot as the youth she gave him, or the ram,
Which from the Caldron leap't a frisking lamb,
Such boundlesse power doth on numbers wait
Without a blasphemy they can create,
Nor have they fame and strength alone, but can
Surfet the unconfin'd desires of man,
With soul-transporting pleasure and content,
Not to be thought on without ravishment:
For when the ranging fancy hath in vain
Pursued delight through all things, yet remains
Still empty, these with satisfaction fill;
Deucalions ship rests on Parnassus hill.
For as he sung, that was the blithest swain,
That ever finger'd pipe on flowry plain,
You may in these as oft as you shall chuse,
"Hugge sweet content with your retired Muse,
"And in those studies find as much to please,
"As others in the greatest Palaces,
"Instead of hounds, that make the wooded hils
"Talk in an hundred voices to the rills,
"Hear you the pleasing cadence of a line;
"Struck by the consort of the sacred nine.
"In lieu of hawks, the raptures of your soul,
"Transcend their pitch, and baser earths controll;
"For running horses, let your fancies flie
"Like arrows that outrun the hunting eye;
"For courtly dancing, you may take more pleasure.
"To hear your verse keep time and equall measure,




"All this without expence, when others oft,
"With their undoings have their pleasures bought,
Such are the Poets joyes, as be no lesse
Than th' image of eternal happinesse,
Like heavens; none these, save the enjoyers know,
And they themselves better conceive than show,
Reveng'd on their ignorance are those,
Which tread the morter of untempred prose,
Whose groveling fancies, and too low pitcht eye
Cannot reach up unto the Poets skie,
And yet like those that to shoot up are bold,
At what their dazled sense cannot behold,
Against the poet saucily dare vent
Their barrn fancies, frothy excrement,
Pitiing their ignorance, wish you no worse,
Than what was once the noble Sydneys curse,
May Cupid wound them, and they lye forlorn,
As pitied objects of their mistresse scorn,
Wanting that fire which warms the poets brain
To thaw the ice of her deserv'd disdain,
Till dead with grief, they make the Muses laugh
To see their names deni'd an Epitaph,
And all their fame inearthed with their herse,
Rotting for want of an embalming verse.

Contemn their scorns and with a brave disdain,
Sleight all those toyes, that others entertain,
Which onely study how to wear their clothes,
And fill up their imperfect speech with oaths,
Scruing their body into every shape,
And are content to be the common ape
Of every Nation, so they may but be
In fashion with their flanting braverie;
Whose best discourse can no more skill impart,
Than tales of hawks and hounds in terms of art,




Who, if they have a tatling spur and bear,
Heads light as the gay feathers which they wear,
Whistle in silks and sometimes can invent
Occasion for a thread-bare complement,
And make a gaudie hilted rapier ride,
Hid in as fine a scabbard, on their side,
As more for shew than use; talk of a wench
With more disease than language of the French,
In whom inventious tailours forming art,
And the spruce barbour claims a greater part,
Than nature or their education can,
Think themselves are the onely Gentile man,
And complete, gallant for this outward dresse,
And gilded trim, when they are nothing lesse;
But shapes of men, and speaking butterflies,
Attracting onely fools, and childrens eyes.

Let these enjoy their humours, whose descent,
And blood's the best and onely argument
That they can use to prove them Gentlemen;
Whilst by the raptures of your learned pen,
Your sweet pac'd numbers and harmonious layes,
You get the solid, and enduring praise,
And shew your worth and birth by a divine,
And better far than your forefathers line.
 
Pay then the Muses Tithes, and let those powers
Of sacred verse, share in your idle hours,
Those ravell'd thrums of time on fruitlesse play,
And emptinesse should not be thrown away.
Those threads of patcht up vacant hours may
Make cloths will serve you for a working day;
The product rising from such vacant hours 
Makes this to be what I my self am---

Yours

THE PREFACE, 
Being a short Institution 
OF 
ENGLISH POESIE.

IT is the ordinary misfortune of posthumous
works, like Orphans, to be exposed to the mer­
cy of others; insomuch, that when they come 
to appear in the world, they have not those ac­
commodations, which such as are advanced by 
their own parents and friends, commonly have. 
Were the learned Author of this laborious work 
alive to see this production of his abilities, and 
extraordinary industry come abroad, there nee­
ded not any to give account of it but himself. For 
who could have said more for the advantage and 
ornament of Poesy, than a person who had so for­
tunately spent both his time and endeavours to 
cultivate it in the highest manner that could be? 
But since he is not, the Reader must accordingly
abate of his expectation, and, instead of large In­
stitution of Poesie, such as might well attend the 
present Work into the world, accept of such as




slight account thereof, as may be proportionable 
to their capacities, for whose improvement, in­
struction, and convenience, these endeavours of 
his were intended. They indeed were calcula­
ted for their meridian who stood subject to the 
ferula; which yet hinders not, but they may indif­
ferently contribute to the assistance of all those, 
who find in themselves any natural inclination or
happinesse of thought more than ordinary, to ex­
presse themselves in verse.

We are then to note, that as the world became
more and more civilized, Harmony, I mean that 
of speech and mutual expression one to another, 
grew more and more into reputation. Hence is
it that those languages are considered as the most 
refined that are most susceptible of Harmony, and 
those most favouring of incivility and barbarisme,
wherein a man cannot expresse himselfe without 
harshnesse and discord. This harmony, in prose,
consists in an exact placing of the accent, and an
accurate disposition of the words; such as delight­
ing the ear, doth in a manner captivate the passi­
ons and the understanding. Of this, strange in­
stances might be made in the ancient Orators,
who may be said to lead the people whither they
pleased. In Poesie, it consists besides the afore­
said conditions of Prose in measure, proportion and 
Rhime. All we have to say relates only to the




latter, and in that, confining our selves particular­
ly to English Poesie.
 
There are some, who in point of Poetry attri­
bute so much to Nature that they think all rules
and directions absolutely unnecessary, and conse­
quently that it is not reducible to any Art; and 
this they categorically affirme of some Nations,
allowing to others greater advantages and incli­
nations to perfection and excellency therein, as
particularly to the Greeks and Latines. But those 
certainly consider not that we are equally the 
children of Nature; that wit, and happinesse of 
conceit are an universal patrimony, and that there 
are in every language certain heights proportiona­
ble to their Idiome, as may very much advance 
Poetry. Besides the injustice they do the modern
Languages, often comparing their Poetry to that 
of the Greek and Latines, and finding it some­
what disconsonant they presently condemne it as 
savage and barbarous, when haply, consider'd with
relation to the Languages, it is much the more 
excellent. To which may be added the advanta­
ges, in point of Poetry, accrewing by Rhime, and 
consequently that the Languages that are enrich­
ed by it, are the most susceptible of Poesie. But 
for these and the like controversies arising concer­
ning Poetry, we refer those that are desirous of fur­
ther satisfaction to the defence of Poesie, written by
Sir Philip Sidney, printed at the end of the Arca­




dia; Mr. Sa. Daniel's Apologie for Rhime, written
in answer to a Pamphlet in his time, entituled Ob­
servations in the Art of English Poesie; and a certain 
Treatise entituled, The Art of English Poesie, di­
vided into three Books, the first of Poets and 
Poesie; the second of Proportion, and the third of
Ornament, printed in the year 1589. treating of 
Poesie in generall, and exemplifying in the Eng­
lish.

As to English Poesie, we shall lay it down as 
granted, that it may be fortunate in any kind, and 
upon any subject, if it meet with a true son of Par­
nassus, and a genius that knowes how to manage 
it. And yet we find by experience that the most
considerable, and for ought can be found, the 
most fortunate therein were a sort of Chimists,
men of much leisure, and sedentary lives, who 
writ altogether in Stanza's. In so much that for
some centuries of years, the greatest part of Eng­
lish Poetry, was spent on those barren and indeed 
abstruse subjects of Chymistry, and the Philosophers
stone, as I have it from a Gentlemans observation, 
who is excellently well versed in Treatises of 
that nature, and hath a strange, and almost incre­
dible collection thereof. But the English Lan­
guage ariving daily to greater perfection and pu­
rity, Poesie must needs accordingly extend to all 
subjects and occasions, incident to humane life; and 
since it admits of the same division into spe­




cies, as the Greek and Latine, we must, being obli­
ged to them for their Termes, submit to their 
Method.

The chiefest of all the species of Poesie, is the 
Heroick, or Epick, as being a representation of 
Heroes, or great and fortunate men, and accor­
dingly requiring a certain state and Majesty suita­
ble to the persons it represents. Some, in Mr. 
Johnson's time, vainly attempted to write a Hero­
ick poem, in imitation of the Greeks and Latines,
by the measures of Spondey and Dactyl, without 
any regard to rime. Of that number was he, who 
sent him a coppy of verses beginning thus,

Benjamin immortal Johnson most highlie renowned.

In this kind were written by the Ancients, all 
kind of Historical Poesie, performed by most of the 
Europian Languages, till of late, by way of Stan­
za's.

A second species of Posie is the Lyrick, which 
is of such extent, that it may be made use of on a­
ny occasion. To this head are referred Madrigals,
Sonnets, Hymnes, Ballets, Odes, whereof some are 
amorous, some rural, some military, some jovial,
made for drollery and drinking; in a word, what 
suits best with the Poets humour. To these may 
be added, Epithalamiums, written upon occasion 
of Nuptials, Epinicions, of Victories, Genethliacks




of Nativities, Congratulatories, &c. The most e­
minent of all writers of this kind, were among 
the Latines Horace and Catullus.

A third species is that of Elegies, Threnodies,
and such like long-breathed Poems on luctiferous 
subjects. To this is reducible, what ever may 
be said on sad and dolefull occasions. Of this 
Ovid in his book de Tristibus, is, as it were, the 
Grand Exemplar.

A fourth kind is that which is called Dramatick
Poesie, divisible into diverse species, and compre­
hending, Tragedies, Comedies, Interludes, Masks,
Entertainments, Dialogues, Satyres, Frolicks,
Georgicks, Pastoralls, Piscatories, Nauticals (which 
three last, passe commonly under the name of Ec­
logues) Memoralls and the like. In these the Poet
is not strictly obliged to rhime, but only to mea­
sure, being such as are principally intended for 
the stage, the main grace hereof consists in repre­
sentation and action. Of all these, the most an­
cient is the Satyre, a kind of writing, reproving
common and popular abuses, so called, for the 
bitternesse and invectives thereof, which was
such that to regulate and reforme their li­
centiousnesse and exorbitance Tragedies and 
Comedies were introduc'd.

A fift is the Epigram, a facetious kind of
writing, full of spirit, humour, and fancy. 
It is of a vast extent, as comprehending Epi­




taphs, Characters, Emblems, Devices, Motto's, 
Hieroglyphicks, Definitions, Aphorisms, Distri­
butions, Paradoxes, Rebus's, Problems. It is full 
of mirth and salt, sententious, directive, as to Mo­
rality, proverbiall, Mythologicall, Enigmaticall, in a 
word hath all humane actions and accidents to 
work upon, closing up all with a certain smartnesse
of conceit. The numerous brood of it, are, ingenious 
fallacies in, and extra dictionem, Encomiasticks, Vi­
tuperatories, Scoffs, Sarcasms, Jeers, Jests, Quibbles, 
Clinches, Quippes, Bulls, Anagrams, Chronograms, 
Acrosticks, Criticismes, in a word whatever is of 
Succinct and concise Poetry, on what subject soe­
ver, handsomly couched, and worded.

To these may lastly be added certain Poeticall
Treatises concerning Learning, Science, or some 
particular sect of Philosophy, such as that of 
Lucretius, Epistolary writings, such as those of 
Ovid, wherein he hath been imitated by Mr. 
Drayton, and Historicall as Lucan, imitated by the 
same Drayton and Daniel, and translated and sup­
plied by Mr. Thomas May, both in Latine and 
English.

Having thus made a hasty dissection of Poesie
into its severall species, it is now time we de­
scend to some few particular instructions, which 
duly observed, may contribute something to the 
ornament and embellishment thereof. There is, as 
we hinted before, a certain harmony in Prose,




much more necessary is it in Verse, whereof the 
grace and advantage consists altogether in the 
Symphony and cadence.

The first Observation then, shall be to endea­
vour such a disposition of the words, as that, 
without much labour to the tongue, they make a 
certain melody in the ear, which no sooner hears
it, but she judges whether the words be placed so, 
as to be pronounced without violence by the ac­
cent; whence this verse; though it hath the just 
number of feet, runs harshly to the ear, by rea­
son of the misplacing of the accent.

None think reward rendred worthy his worth.

The case is the same when by an inconsiderable 
alteration, as haply that of one word, makes
what was before harsh become smooth and 
pleasant.

For instance this,

Though death doth consume, yet verue preserves,

with a little transposition will run well enough 
thus,

Though death doth ruine, vertue yet preserves.

This discovers of what consequence the ex­
act observation of the accent is, which, like 
right time in Musick, produces harmony, the want 
of it harshnesse, and discord. In like manner 
Rhime depends altogether on the accent; whence 
it comes that many words terminating alike, yet




never rhime well, such as wéaknesse and confésse, 
náture and endúre, fortune and importune, &c. 
This is soon discovered by the ear.

The second, to avoid as much as may be long
Parentheses, which are a certain torture to the Rea­
der, forcing him to alter his tone till he come to 
the close of the Parenthesis, and causing in the 
hearer a distraction and suspence till the sense be u­
nited. Examples of this are so frequent, we need 
not quote any. Some late writers have endeavou­
red to avoid them even in Prose, and the attempt 
ought to be cherished and seconded, nor indeed 
is it very difficult.

To this head may be added a certain licentious­
nesse, which some English Poets have in imitati­
on of the Greek and Latine, presumed on to dis­
member, and disjoyn things that should naturally
march together; placing some words at such a di­
stance one from another, as will not stand with the 
English Idiome. Nay sometimes they fall down 
into flat prose; a kind of Licentia poetica by no 
means allowable in English, such is that of these 
verses.

But now that she is wearied with the toil
Of balling, and that all her spirits boil
With scortching flames of the blind Archers fire,
Which kindleth no lesse vehement desire,
In her inamorato's, hence she goes,
Having farewel'd the company, at whose




Earnest entreaty she was pleas'd to come
Into afair and well adjusted room, &c.

A third caution is, to avoid, as much as may be, 
frequent Apostrophe's, because of harshnesse and 
disturbance consequent thereto, such we have in 
this verse.

The husband is the head, as soon's h' unlocks

Where the words as and he, are apostrophated, 
which cannot be well admitted. It is ordinary 
with the same Author to apostrophate us, his, by,
to, be, very, &c. very harshly, and not without vio­
lence to the ear.

A fourth is to avoid feminine rimes, such as cha­
rity and parity, double and trouble, Dunstable, and
Constable, &c. which in a verse of ten syllables or 
Heroick, speaks a certain flatnesse derogatory from 
the Majesty thereof, and if any where they may
be allowed, it is in Ditties and Sonnets, and there 
hardly, Poesie being now arrived to such purity 
and perfection.

With this we forbid the use of polysyllables,
such as are proper to prose, and come not into verse
without a certain violence, such as representation,
skilfulness, remediles, reciprocally, convertible, spright­
fully; as also the frequent use of words, that have 
the accent on the fourth sillable from the termi­




nation; as territory, disputable, protonotary, & the like.

A fifth, may be an exact observation of the 
rime, as that wherein all the symphony and mu­
sick of a verse consists. In this Sir Thomas Ur­
quhart, a man of an extraordinary fancy, may be 
said to be negligent, or indeed it is the fault of his 
Countrey, which being obliged to France for 
many things, derive thence a liberty not admitta­
ble in English Poesie. Such is that of terminating
with the same letters, as conceive, and receive, sun, 
and son, resent and consent, &c. frequent in French
Poetry, or such as not allowed, Poesie, would be 
lost among them.

As also that of making two words that have but 
any affinity in sound, to serve for rhime, as effects,
and takes, expression and copulation, lean and den,
late and set; frequent in Scotch Poets, as it were in 
imitation of the French, among whom it is tole­
rable.

Lastly, for the Epithets, which well placed and 
significant, are no small ornament in a Poeme. These 
we would have to adde something to the signifi­
cation of the Substantive, that it may not be 
thought they onely fill up the line. Thus to say, 
briny sea, is no more than to say, the sea, the woody
grove is no more than a grove, nor were it amisse
to avoid a sort of harsh compound words, much 
affected by some, such as Thunder-thumping Jove, 
tempest-raising winds, which reading and experi­




ence will soon discover to be the issues of hollow 
brains, filled with nought but wind.

Thus having run through this short Anatomy 
of Poesie, all now remains to do is, in few words,
to give some little account of the Author, and the
design and scope of the present work, for the Au­
thor he had sometime the charge and management 
of a private School at Hadley near Barnet in the 
County of Middlesex, kept in the house of a wor­
thy Gentleman, one Mr. Francis Atkinson, who 
out of a design truly generous, and publick, ende­
vouring to prevent the inconveniences of irregu­
lated youth, set up a School or Academy, for the 
education of a select number of Gentlemens sons
of good quality. There, it seems, as he confesseth
in his Epistle to the said Mr. Atkinson, he writ this 
elaborate piece. But this is not his first appea­
rance in the world; for in the year 1655. came
forth a book of his called the ENGLISH ACCI­
DENCE, very usefull for such as it was intended
for, as teaching a way to make him that can but in­
differently read English, to turn any sentence into 
pure and elegant Latine, Printed for R. Lownds at 
the white Lion in Pauls Churchyard.

For the Work, he hath divided it into three parts.
The first treats of all rhimes imaginable in English 
(as the base and foundation of Poesie) according
to their severall terminations. The second furnishes
the diligent Lover of the Muses, with excellent




choice and variety of apposite Epithets, somewhat 
in imitation of Textors in the Latine. The third 
is an ample treasury of phrases, and elegant expres­
sions, gathered out of the best esteemed English 
Authors that have writ in the severall kinds of 
Poesie, not unlike that of Thesaurus Poeticus, in
Latine. And all this is performed by such an excel­
lent method, and a certain alphabetical disposition, 
for the greater ease and convenience of those that 
shall be desirous to advance themselves thereby, 
that it may be confidently said, the design is ab­
solutely new, there having not any thing of this 
kind appeared upon the English stage before.
 
So that there seems nothing requisite to com­
pleat the great structure of this ENGLISH 
PARNASSUS, or Poeticall Institution, but a 
Rhetoricall Treatise, such as may acquaint and fur­
nish the industrious student with these advantages
and imbellishments, that advance as well Prose, as 
Poetry to the highest pitch. And such a Treatise 
there is already in the Printers hands, to be sud­
denly put into the Presse, intituled, ENGLISH 
RHETORICH, and that drawn by the same 
hand, and polished by the same indefatigable in­
dustry, as this PARNASSUS, And of that 
RHETORICH, there is the like presumption, 
that proceeding from the same Author, that is, be­
ing such as pruned off whatever is burdensome,




and unnecessary, and comprehending all that is
beneficiall and conducing to the improvement of
such as shall desire it, it will meet with a reward 
suitable to an undertaking of such concernment to 
all learning, a generall encouragement acceptati­
on, and applause.

TO THE READER.

READER,
 
THou hast here, what some would count big 
enough to deserve the name of Booke,
and give thee arguments from the indu­
stry in the compiling, and benefit in the 
use, to work thee to a liking, and extort thy appro­
bation. For my own part, if thou wilt be pleased to 
pardon the aspiring loftinesse of the title, and to 
consider for whom it was intended; Nec Suffae­
nus sum, nec inscribo Praxitelem. If thou find­
est any thing here either for thy pleasure or profit, 
thank not me, but the greatnesse of the volume: 
for could it have been easily transcribed, or any o­
ther way made generally usefull to all them for 
whose sakes I have principally taken this pains; it 
had neither troubled thee, nor the Presse: nor had
I added one more to the numberlesse multitude of 
scriblers. Condemn it as unworthy the light in 
what words thou pleasest, and I shall owe thee
thanks for giving my thoughts expression by thy 
language. If thou disapprovest it and art a wise 
man; I shall be too proud to know an understanding
man of my judgement: if thou beest a foole, I shall 
not be very sory to see some hopes of an improve­
ment in thy judgement, by beginning in this to




know what justly to condemne. If thou commendest
any thing, whether thou beest wise or otherwise, I
shall be so far from giving thee thanks, that I shall
be halfe angry with thee, for so much crossing my
expectation. Vale.
