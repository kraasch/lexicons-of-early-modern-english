THE
PREFACE.

ALTHOUGH it may be needless to insist of the
usefulness of Dictionaries in general, in regard that
Words are introductory to the knowledge of Things,
and no Arts or Sciences can be attain'd without a right under­
standing of their peculiar Terms: yet we think it expedient
to give some account of our present undertaking: The main
design of which, is to instruct Youth, and even adult Per­
sons, who are ignorant of the Learned Languages, in the Or­
thography, or true and most accurate manner of Spelling,
Reading and Writing the genuine Words of their own Mo­
ther-tongue. For that purpose, we have taken care to make
a Collection of all the most proper and significant English
Words, that are now commonly us'd either in Speech, or
in the familiar way of Writing Letters, &c; omitting at the
same time, such as are obsolete, barbarous, foreign or pe­
culiar to the several Counties of England; as also many diffi­
cult, abstruse and uncouth Terms of Art, as altogether un­
necessary, nay even prejudicial to the endeavours of young
Beginners, and unlearned Persons, and whereof seldom
any use does occur: However, the most useful Terms
in all Faculties are briefly explain'd; more especially those
that relate to Divinity, Ecclesiastical Affairs, the Statute­
Laws of the Nation, History, Geography, Maritime Affairs,
Plants, Gardening, Husbandry, Mechanicks; Handicrafts,
Hunting, Fowling, Fishing, &c.

The whole Work is digested into Alphabetical order, in
which the different senses of Original Words are set down,
and where 'tis needful they are also illustrated with a clear

and short Exposition; so as the true meaning of their re­



spective Derivatives and Compounds may be easily discover'd.
But to prevent the bulk of the Volume from swelling be­
yond its due Bounds, 'tis judg'd expedient only to leave out
the common Terminations of Verbs and Adverbs, that may
be form'd from their Primitives, with a very little applica­
tion; and of which an Example or two, may serve for the
Reader's future Direction: Thus from the Verb To love, it
is easy to deduce the Participles loved and loving, and from the
latter, the Adverb lovingly, by adding to the Primitive, the
usual Terminations of ed, ing, and ly. Again, the Parti­
ciples disposed and disposing are naturally deriv'd from the
Verb to dispose; in like manner the Adverb deliciously, takes
its rise from the Adjective delicious and so of the rest: More­
over, the Positive, or first degree of Comparison of all Ad­
jectives, that are regularly compar'd is only inserted; it be­
ing no difficult matter to add the proper Terminations of er
and est; as rich, richer, richest; wise, wiser, wisest; noble,
nobler, noblest; &c. These few Rules being duely observ'd,
the Work will appear uninterrupted, and altogether confor­
mable to the usual method of Dictionaries.

And it may be  affirm'd, That no other Book of the same
nature, is as yet extant; altho' there are two, which seem
to come near our present Design; Viz. a little Tract first
set forth by John Bulloker Doctor of Physick, unter the Ti­
tle of An English Expositor, and Mr. E. Cole's English Di­
ctionary. The former is defective in several respects, and
yet abounds with difficult Terms, which are here purposely
avoided, for the above-mention'd Reasons; neither is the lat­
ter free from the like unprofitable Redundancy. For it is
observable, That Mr. Coles in his elaborate Work, has in­
serted several Words purely Latin, without any alteration,
as Dimidietas for an half; Sufflamen, for a Trigger, and
some hundreds only vary'd with an #English Termination,
which are scarce ever us'd by any ancient or modern Wri­
ter, even in a Figurative, Philosophical, or Poetical Sense;
such as Ægrimony and Ægroting for Sickness; Beneplacity,
well pleasing; Egestuosity, extreme poverty; Elingued,
tongue-tied; To egurgitate or disgorge; Graveolence, a rank
or strong scent; Gynecocracy, a  Greek Term denoting Femi­
nine Government; Horripilation, the standing up of the Hair



for fear; Horrisonant, making a terrible noise; Ignifluous,
flowing with Fire; Ignipotent, mighty by Fire; Impluvious,
without Rain; Innubilous, without Clouds; Internecion, an
universal slaughter; Largifical, bountiful; Nidifice, a Nest;
Odoraminous, sweet-smelled; To offuscate, or darken; A
Pronephew, from Pronepos, for a Nephew's Son; Receptitious,
received; Scaturiginous, full of Springs; Scelestique, wicked;
sevidical, speaking cruelly; To sufflaminate, or skatch a
wheel; Sulcation, a making Furrows; Supplice, Punish­
ment; Susurration, a whispering, &c. Likewise many other
Terms that are very uncouth and unintelligible; as Annex­
ation Dapocaginous, To elacerate, To eglomerate, Fritiniancy,
Helaution, Umbiligality, Yvernagium, &c  Besides an innume­
rable multitude of Greek, Latin, French, Italian, Spanish, Bri­
tish, Saxon, and old English Words that are often introduc'd
even without changing their Original Terminations, and
which are never used in English; with others that are pecu­
liar to distinct Counties of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and
never us'd or understood any where else. So that a plain
Country-man, in looking for a common English Word, amidst
so vast a Wood of such as are above the reach of his Capa­
city, must needs lose the sight of it, and be extremely dis­
couraged, if not forc'd to give over the search.

Neither are Mr. Cole's Expositions always proper, or per­
tinent, particularly, of the Word Revolution, which he only
defines to be a turning round to the first point; but this Term,
which simply denotes a whirling round, is us'd in Astronomy,
for a certain Course of Planets, Time, &c. and in com­
mon acceptation, for some notable change, especially of Go­
vernment. Moreover, in the explaining English Words
deriv'd from the Latin, he makes no scruple of producing
such senses as are only peculiar to the Original; as will plain­
ly appear from an instance or two, viz. The Term Insolent
is rightly Interpreted by our Author, Proud or Arrogant; but
he also adds, contrary to common Custom, which last sense is
never used in English; altho' Insolens in  Latin admits of both
significations: Again, he renders the Word Personate, to re­
present one's Person, also to sound aloud; whereas the latter
sense only belongs to the Latin Verb Persono. We cannot for­
bear adding a third instance, which is very remarkable,
viz. Villication, the Rule of Husbandry, under the Master of a



Mannour; a strange Term, explain'd by a no less odd De­
finition: Indeed we meet with the Latin Word Villicatio in
Columella & other Authors, which may well be interpreted,
A Stewardship or Bailyship in the Country; also the Hiring or
managing of a Farm. However, it must be acknowledged,
That the Design of this Ingenious Author (from whose Merit
it is not our intention in the least to derogate) is very
different from ours; That apparently being to oblige the
Publick, with as large a Collection as possibly could be
made, of all sorts of hard and obsolete Words, both do­
mestick and foreign, as well Proper Names, as the Terms of
all Arts and Sciences, Poetical Fictions, &c. Whereas, ours is
intended only to explain such English Words as are genuine,
and used by Persons of clear Judgement and good Style;
leaving out all those foreign Terms, that in Mr. Cole's time
were viciously introduc'd into our Language, by those who
sought to approve themselves Learned rather by unintelligi­
ble Words than by proper Language.

Lastly, it ought to be observ'd, That very few of the ge­
nuine and common significant Words of the English Tongue
are contain'd in either of the two Dictionaries but now ci­
ted, or in any other particular Work of the like nature, hi­
therto published; as has been already hinted. To conclude,
the usefulness of this Manual to all Persons not perfectly
Masters of the English Tongue, and the assistance it gives
to young Scholars, Tradesmen, Artificers and others, and
particularly, the more ingenious Practitioners of the Fe­
male Sex; in attaining to the true manner of Spelling of
such Words, as from time to time they have occasion to
make use of, will, we hope procure it a favourable Rece­
ption. The Author does not expect a Recompence pro­
portioned to the great Trouble and Pains he has taken, but
will have full satisfaction, if the Publick reap as much Be­
nefit by his Work, as he has bestow'd Labour in Compiling
it.

Z O

The Zodiack, an imagi­
nary Circle in the Hea­
ven, taking name from
the Greek word Zoon,
i. e. an animal, because
'tis adorned with twelve
Signs or Images, most
of which resemble liv­
ing creatures. It cros­
ses the Æquator in two
points, viz. in the be­
ginning of Aries and Li­
bra, and the Ecliptick
Line passes through the
middle of it.

The Sun goes about this
Circle once every year,
and the Moon once in a
Month: The former ne­
ver swerves from the
Ecliptick, but the Moon
and the rest of the Pla­
nets wander up and
down, for the space of
eight degrees on each
side; upon which ac­
count, the breadth of
the Zodiack is supposed
to take up 16 degrees.

See the Signs of the Zo­
diack.

Zones, (i. e. Girdles) are
certain spaces, or parts
of the Earth, distin­
guished by several
names, according to the
different temperature
of the Air, and are
five in number, viz. one
Torrid, two Temperature,
and two Frigid.

The Torrid Zone lies be­
tween the two Tropicks
of Cancer and Capri­
corn, taking up 47 de­
grees of Latitude, that
is to say, 940 leagues,
or 2820 miles. 'Tis cal­
led Torrid, i. e. parch­
ed, or burning-hot, from
its excessive and constant
heat, caused by the con­
tnual course of the Sun,
between the Tropicks;
insomuch that the An­
cients erroneously be­
lieved it to be altogether
unhabitable.

The Temperate Zones,
are one Northern, and
the other Southern:
The former, (in which
we live) extends it self
between the Tropick of
Cancer and the Arctick
Circle, and the other
between the Tropick of
Capricorn, and the An­
tarctick Circle; so that
they apparently owe
their name, with the
advantages of the Cli­
mate to their Situation
between the extremities
of the Torrid and Fri­
gid Zones; and each of
'em takes up 43 degrees
of Latitude; about 860
leagues, or 2580 miles.

The Frigid Zones, like­
wise one on the North,
and the other on the
South, are situated in
the farthermost parts of
the World; that is to
say, the Northern be­
tween the Arctick Circle
and the Arctick Pole,
and the Southern be­
tween the Antarctick Cir­
cle and the Pole of the
same name: So that
each of them contains
23 degrees and a half,
470 leagues, or 1410
miles.

These two Zones are
call'd Frigid, i. e. ex­
ceeding cold or frozen,
because being extremely
remote from the Sun's
Course in the Zodiack,
they partake but little
of its heat, recieving its
Rays oblique and with­
out reflection; upon
which account, the anci­
ent Geographers and
Historians, could not
imagine them to be at
all Inhabited no more
than the Torrid Zone
for its vehement heat;
but their mistakes are
now sufficiently disco­
vered.

Zoophytes, (q. d. plant­
animals) a Philosophical
Term, denoting things
that are as it were of a
middle nature, between
Plants and Living­
creatures, as Spunges,
