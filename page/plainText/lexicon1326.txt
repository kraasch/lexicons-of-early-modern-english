PREFACE
THe Design of the following Sheets
is so fully explained by the Title 
Page, that there is but little Occasion for
any other Introduction than what that 
might furnish. A very short Preface
may therefore suffice.

THE Compiler cannot charge himself
with having spared any Pains to render
them correct, and so useful, as might 
justify his Publication of them to the
World.

AND 'tis hoped, it will not be pleaded 
to his Disadvantage, that whilst this
Work answers all the valuable Purposes



that ought to be expected from a Per­
formance of this Nature, 'tis so fitted, 
as at Pleasure to be made a Pocket Com­
panion, and for a very small Expence to
become the Source of Amusement or In­
stuction Abroad as well as at Home.

THIS being the Author's first Essay
of this Sort, he commits it to the Can­
dour of those who will condescend to give
it Reception, humbly hoping for the Ap­
probation of the Publick, if upon Perusal
it shall be found that he has endeavoured
to deserve it.
