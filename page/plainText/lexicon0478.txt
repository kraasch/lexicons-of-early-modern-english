TO THE
READER. 
 

AFter I had bestowed the waste hours of
some years in reading our best English
Histories and Authors; I found, though
I had gained a reasonable knowledge in
the Latine and French Tongues, as I
thought, and had a smattering both of
Greek and other Languages, yet I was often gravelled
in English Books; that is, I encountred such words, as
I either not at all, or not throughly understood, more
then what the preceding sence did insinuate; For Ex­
ample: 

In the Turkish History I met with Ianizaries, Muf­
ties, Timariots, Basha's, Seraglio's, Shashes,
Turbants, &c. 

In the French History, the Salique Law, Appen­
nages, Vidams, Daulphin, &c. 





In the Spanish, the Escurial, Infanta, Sanbent­
to, &c. 

In the Roman Histories I found often mention of Con­
suls, Tribunes, Dictators, Pretors, Cohorts, Le­
gions, Theaters, Obelisks ; The Capitol, Vatican,
Pasquin &c. 

And in many other Books, mention of several Reli­
gious Orders: as Carmelites, Carthusians, Cister­
sians Theatins, Bonhomes, &c. So likewise both
of ancient and modern Sects; as Arrians, Eutychi­
ans, Iacobites, &c. Anabaptists, Arminians, Erasti­
ans, Traskites, Socinians, Quakers, &c. 

In Books of Divinity, I found Sanhedrim, Vrim
andThummin, Sanctum Sanctorum, Shibboleth,
Hypostatical, Circuminsession, &c. 

In every Mercurius, Coranto, Gazet or Diurnal, I
met with Canizado's, Lantspezado's,
Brigades, Squadrons, Curassiers, Bonemines,
Halts, Juncta's, Paroles, &c. 

In the mouths of Common people, I heard of Piazza,
Balcone, &c. in London : And in the Country, of
Hocktide, Minnyng days, Lurdanes, Quintins, &c. 

Nay, to that pass we are now arrived, that in London
many of the Tradesmen have new Dialects; The Cook
askes you what Dishes you will have in your Bill of
Fare; whether Olla's, Bisques, Hachies, Omelets,
Bouillon's, Grilliades, Ioncades, Fricasses ; with a
Hautgoust, Ragoust, &c. 

The Vintner will furnish you with Montesiascone,
Alicant, Vernaccia, Ribolla, Tent &c. Others with
Sherbet, Agro di Cedro, Coffa, Chocolate, &c, 

The Taylor is ready to mode you into a Rochet, Man­
dillion, Gippen, Iustacor, Capouch, Hoqueton, or a
Cloke of Drap de Bery, &c. 

The Shoo-maker will make you Boots, Whole 





Chase, Demi-Chase, or Bottines, &c. 

The Haberdasher is ready to furnish you with a Vi­
gone, Codebec or Castor, &c. The Semstress with a
Crabbat, Toylet, &c. 

By this new world of Words, I found we were slipt into
that condition which Seneca complains of in his time;
When mens minds once begin to enure themselves to
dislike, whatever is usual is disdained : They affect no­
velty in speech, they recal oreworn and uncouth words,
they forge new phrases, and that which is newest is best
liked; there is presumptuous, and far fetching of words:
And some there are that think it a grace, if their
speech hover, and thereby hold the hearer in sus­
pence, &c. 
I beleeved my self not singular in this ignorance; and
that few, without the help of a Dictionary, would be a­
ble to understand our ordinary English Books; I found
nothing considerable in this kind extant, though now ma­
ny make it their study to be learned in our own Language;
and I remembred Aristotles, Verba valent in usu sicut
& nummi. For these Reasons, and to comply with my
own fancy, I began to compile this Work; which has
taken me up the vacancy of above Twenty years. 

Besides the Words of the nature before specified,
you have here such and so many of the most useful Law­
Terms as I thought necessary for every Gentleman of E­
state to understand, not intending any thing for the stu­
died Professors of that noble Science, there being some
excellent Peeces of that nature already extant 

The several parts of mans body, as the Pia andDu­
ra Mater, the Missentery, Muscles, several sorts of
Veins, and Arteries, &c. with their proper Appellati­
ons; As also the names and qualities of at least ordinary
Diseases, I thought fit for the knowledge of many, who
neither profess the study of Physick, Anatomy nor Chy­
rurgery. 





I held it no less necessary for every Gentleman to be
so far seen in Heraldry, as to know (at least) the most
usual Terms; as when a Lyon or other Beast is said to
be Dormant, Passant, Couchant, Saliant, Ram­
pant, Seisant, &c. and what is meant by a Fesse, a
Canton, a Bend, &c. that he may by consequence be able
at least to blazon his own Coat. 

Here are likewise explicated all Latin words, that
are used without alteration in English, as Encomium,
Peccavi, Verbatim, Virago, Bona fide, De bene
esse, &c. And, with these, the terms of many Sciences un­
folded; as of Logick, Astrology, Geometry, Musick,
Architecture, Navigation, &c. with those of our most in­
genious Arts, and Exercises, as Printing, Painting, Jewel­
ling, Riding, Hunting, Hawking, &c 

Yet I will not say I have met with all that might
require Explication, for that were an imployment for
Archymedes, Pulveris Erythræi subducere numerum;
But I have inserted such as are of most use, and best
worth knowledge; that is,  Quæ nunc sunt in honore
vocabula. To some words I have added Etymologies,
to others, Historical Observations, as they occured, and
this but ex obliquo. 

I have avoided Poetical Stories, as much as I could
since they are not necessary to be understood by the Ge­
nerality; And as for Schollars and Poets, there is a copi­
ous Latine Dictionary of them and somewhat of late done
in English by Mr. Ross: Yet sometimes I am forced to touch
a little upon that string; as to tell the story of Pandora, to
make her Box understood; and that of Tantalus, to ren­
der the word Tantalize intelligible. 

I have likewise in a great measure, shun' d the old
Saxon Words; as finding them growing every day more
obsolete then other. Besides there is an excellent Dictiona­
ry thereof shortly expected from the learned Mr. Somner. 





Yet even such of those, as I found still in use, are not here
omitted. 

In this Design I met with two Objections; The
first, that my labor would find no end; since our English
Tongue daily changes habit; every fantastical Traveller, 
and homebred Sciolist being at liberty, as to antiquate, and
decry the old, so to coyn and innovate new Words: Which
Horace thus observed. 

Ut Sylvæ foliis pronos mutantur in annos:
Prima cadunt; ita verborum vetus interit ætas,
Et juvenum ritu florent modo nata vigentque.
Debemur morti nos, nostraque ----- 
De Arte Poet. 

Signifying hereby that words in Common Tongues, like
leaves, must of necessity have their buddings, their blos­
somings, their ripenings and their fallings: Which old
Chaucer also remarks. 

I know that in form of speech is change
Within a hundred year,and words tho
That hadden price,now wonder nice and strange
Think we them;and yet they spake them so,
And sped as well in love,as men now do . 

This we grant, and confess it impossible to keep Words
of unlearned Tongues from falling and change in tract of
time; which has even happened among the Latine Writers
themselves, when theirs was a spoken tongue as ours now
is; who though they first made their own words, and gave
them their allowance, yet divers of Cecilius Statius, Enni­
us, and Plautus were by posterior Latinists rejected; and 





now again many of them, by the last Writers of all (though
before, as it were, by Proclamation put down for baseness) 
are, upon a new Touch, warranted for good, and pass abroad
as Sterling. Thus we see our Latin Dictionaries seldom
or never Reprinted, without some Additions, Corrections,
or Denotations of obsolete Words: So when any conside­
rable supplement of new English Words have legally pass' d
the Mint and Test of our Vertuosi, the same liberty may
be allowed this Work; not derogating at all from the use of
it in the interim. 

The second Objection was, That the use of such words was
not commendable, according to that of Cæsar, Tanquam sco­
pulum vitari debes verbum infrequens ; and he that should
use them would be subject to the censure of aλοροδαίδαλος,
one that prefers the novelty or affected elegance of the phrase
to the nerves and importance of the sence; which is confu­
ted by our best modern Authors, who have both infinitely
enriched and enobled our Language, by admitting and natu­
ralizing thousands of foraign Words, providently brought
home from the Greek, Roman, and French Oratories;
which though, in the untravel' d ears of our Fathers, would
have sounded harsh, yet a few late years have rendred
them familiar even to vulgar capacities. Witness the
learned Works of the Lord Bacon, Mr. Montagu, Sir
Kenelm Digby, Sir Henry Wotton, Mr. Selden, Mr.
Sands, Dr. Brown, Dr Charlton, Dr. Heylnyn, Mr.
Howel &c. Wherein such words are used more or less: To
many of which I have added the Authors names, that I
might not be thought to be the innovator of them. Nor is
it my purpose to become an Advocate for the use of such
Words; let every ones Genius and the quality of the
Subject they treat of be their own Dictator; But cer­
tainly, at least to understand them, can be no unnecessa­
ry burden to the Intellect; since Knowledge is Animi pa­
bulum. And ' tis Galens Axiom, Who ever is ignorant of 





words shall never judge well of things . Lib.I. de Me­
thod. cap.5. 

My Lord Coke (that Oracle of our Law) 
has left us these words. In School Divinity, 

In Pres.
in Com up­
on Littl.

and among the Glossographers and Inter­ 
 preters of the Civil and Canon Laws, in 
Logick, and other Liberal Sciences, you shall meet with
a whole Army of Words; which cannot defend them­
selves in  Bello Grammaticali, yet are more significant,
compendious, and effectual to declare the true sence
of the matter, then if they were expressed in pure
Latin. 

And Mr. Denham in his quaint Preface to the De­
struction of Troy; As Speech is the Apparel of our 
Thoughts, so are there certain Garbs and Modes of
speaking, which vary with the times; the fashion of
our Clothes not being more subject to Alteration, then
that of our Speech; And this I think Tacitus means,
by that which he calls Sermonem temporis istius auribus
accommodatum ; The delight of change being as due to
the curiosity of the Ear, as of the Eye . 

Having thus solved these two main Objections, I may,
with an humble confidence, hope this Book will prove as
useful to our Nation, as that Congenerous Essay, Des
Merveilles de Nature), done by René, is to the French;
which has been Printed almost twenty several times with­
in less then so many years. 

To compile and compleat a Work of this nature and im­
portance, would necessarily require an Encyclopedie of
knowledge, and the concurrence of many learned Heads;
yet. that I may a little secure the Reader from a just ap­
prehension of my disability for so great an Undertaking, I
profess to have done little with my own Pencil; but have
extracted the quintessence of Scapula, Minsheu, Cotgrave,
Rider, Florio, Thomasius, Dasipodius, and Hexams 





Dutch, Mr. Davies Welsh Dictionary, Cowels Interpre­
ter, &c. and other able Authors, for so much as tended
to my purpose; and hope I have taken nothing upon trust,
which is not authentick; yet should I not thus adventure
to make it publick, but that it also had the perusal and
approbation of some very Learned, and my Noble Friends. 

It is chiefly intended for the more-knowing Women, and
less-knowing Men; or indeed for all such of the unlearn­
ed, who can but finde in an Alphabet, the word they un­
derstand not; yet I think I may modestly say, the best of
Schollers may in some part or other be obliged by it. For
he that is a good Hebrician, Grecian, and Latinist, per­
haps may be to seek in the Italian, French, or Spanish; or
if he be skil' d in all these, he may here finde some Words,
Terms of Art, or Notions, that have no dependence upon
any of those Languages. 

Such as neither understand Greek nor Latin, may, with
a little pains, and the help of this Book, know the mean­
ing of the greatest part of such words as we now use in
English, and are derived from either of those Languages,
which are many. And to facilitate this, they may do well
to learn the numbers in those Languages, as En, dyo,
treis, &c. unus, duo, tres, &c. and such words and par­
ticles as are most used in Composition; as Monos, Hemi,
Pseudos, Tetra, &c. Circum, Subter, Præter, Ultra, &c.
And then in simple words to understand but the nature and
difference between a Verb, Verbal, Noun, Participle, &c.
that when they know one of them, they may also compre­
hend all the Derivatives from the same Fountain; as
toillaqueate,illaqueator,illaqueation,illaqueated,
illaqueable,&c. And by once throughly learning these, all
other words of this nature, which are not a few, would seem
easie. 

So likewise for Compound words, knowing Pseudos to
signifie false, they would understand Pseudo Prophet to 





be a False Prophet; circum, about or round about, cir­
cumstation, a standing round about, &c. with the like.
And this easiness of understanding all the words that
come from one Root, when one of them is known, made me
forbear to insert the whole number of such words; pre­
suming, if the Reader know one or two of them, he will not
be ignorant of the rest; and I have selected the most diffi­
cult. 

Sometimes the same word is used both Substantively and
Adjectively; asDatary,Expedient,&c. And some­
time both Substantively and Verbally; as Attaque,Re­
prive,&c which, being unrestrained in the use, were al­
most impossible to observe in all words; besides, if it be in­
terpreted in the one acception, it will easily be understood
in the other. 
So likewise there is a liberty in most Adjectives, whe­
ther you will say Optique  (after the French) Optick,
Opticous or Optical ; which I thought unnecessary al­
ways to remark. 

If I say a word is Greek, French, Italian, &c. I
speak not always in rigor; for, commonly the words we bor­
row from other Languages, are a little altered from their
Originals, to make them speak English. 

Something might also be said of the choice of Words, in
our refined English Tongue; which are to be liked and ap­
proved according to their tone, and the sweetness of their
cadence, that is, as they run musically in the Ear. Latin
Verbs of the first Conjugation are more usually converted
into English; as contamino, as, to contaminate; Recal­
citro, as, to Recalcitrate, &c. then those of the second,
third, and fourth Conjugations. 

I have made use of several Authors of different per­
swasions in Controversial points, both of Religion and
other Literature, which possibly will not please all Readers;
and therefore must crave pardon, in this particular, if 





some citations pass under a non-liquent, since the nature
of the Words inforced me to have recourse thereto. 

To conclude, though I may truly say I have taken
much pains in this investigation of Words, yet it is but too
probable, that in multiloquio non decrit peccatum; that,
in so great a Circumference, some Lines may not be truly
drawn from the Centre; which yet I hope will not draw an
oblique censure from the Reader, but his pardon rather, and
animadversion; that I may, as St. Austin advises, Et scri­
bendo proficere, & proficiendo scribere, & quæ nescio
discere . De Trin lib.3. cap.I. in Prol. Retract.

TO HIS 

HONORED FRIEND 

Mr. T. B. 

Upon his 

Glossographia. 

HAd Babel, th'old World's Rendevouz
(first mean't
To center Mankinde in one joynt con­
sent
To undue Homage) by that Politick
tye
Setled her Universal Soveraignty,
The World in one vast Fam'ly had combin'd,
Nor labor'd thus to know each other's mind.
Language and Laws had firmly held together,
That Court and Tow'r had been the Mint for either:
But, when Dissension bred a Separation,
And each fixt Colony became a Nation, 





Chance and Design in time more licenc't grew,
And Dialects the Original ensue;
Which by degrees degenerate from their Mother,
Till they disown their birth, and seem another:
Besides, the various Climates tun'd their throats
And vocal Organs, apt for different Notes.
Then, Speech, which in this Analytick vein
Was first resolv'd, compounded grew again,
As Enemies in conquer'd Countries fixt
And ill-according Dialects intermixt;
Which Chance went on corrupting, till th'next so
Subdu'd that Nation, and that Language too. 

But most, in these our Modern times, this Ile
And Language oft became a double spoil
To Foreiners; Pictish with Danish clung
Into our Saxo-Belgick-Norman Tongue.
Not all theIargons, fanci'd to inspire
By miracle that disagreeing Quire
Of Babel' s Bricklayers, were so numerous
As those, which, by degrees, encroach't on us.
Nor was't all-jumbling War which wrought alone
This change, and shuffled many Tongues in one,
But even Peace (such is th'uncertain Fate
Of Speech) which settles all things, alters that.
This nourish't Peace, bred Commerce, which inclin'd
Men to impart th'Expressions of their mind.
Civiler Greek and Latin interlac't
Our rude Ground, with their rich Imbrod'ries grac't.
Smooth France, neat Italy, and manly Spain,
Lent it some tinctures of a quainter strain:
And, as with Merchandize, with terms it fares,
Nations do traffick Words, as well as Wares,
Bon-jour usurps upon our plain Good-morrow,
'Tis Neighborhood's best praise to lend and borrow. 





Travellers, which about the world do roam
Had made us Englishmen, Strangers at home;
'Twas due unto their dearly earned praise
To dress strange Stories in exotick phrase.
Nay homebred heads unsocially did strive
T'estrange themselves andShibboleths contrive;
Tradesmen affected uncoth words to cant,
And blunder in terms non-significant;
Each Company would be thought a little Nation
And coyn a Dialect in their own fashion:
Artists grew Mock-Divines, and needs would teach
Their tricks in mystick words 'bove vulgar reach.

Thus were we at a loss, and none could tell
What Trav' llers, Grandsires, Books or Friends meant, wel.
Wee'd still been thral'd to th' School-boys stupid task,
Pos'd with hard English words, to stop and ask;
Gallants had paid their Crowns to see the Play,
And ne'r known first what meant anOpera;
Had not this thred been spun to lead them through
Our Tongue, grown Labyrinth, and Monster too.
Confusion, in this Book, in Order' s set,
An Heap is form'd into an Alphabet:
Old Babels Ruins this in part repairs
And in an handsom Work the Rubbish rears,
Scattered thence to our Isle; nor shall we now
Unto their Iars our disacquaintance ow.
Rankt i'th' first Class of Moderns this would be,
Had not Wits taken toy at industry,
And thought all profitable subjects dull,
'Cause they too solid are to pierce their Skul,
Pervious to nought but what to th'ear best chimes,
Sliding in low, or cap'ring in high Rymes.
But, since all Science first from Notions springs,
Notions are known by Words; there's nothing brings, 





Then treating these, to Knowledge more advance,
Held Pedantry by witty Ignorance.
In fine, what's due to industrious observation,
And re-acquainting our self-stranger Nation
With its disguised self; what's merited
By rendring our hard English Englished;
What, when our Tongue grew gibbrish, to be then
National Interpreter to Books and Men;
What ever praise does such deserts attend,
Know, Reader, 'tis thy debt unto my Friend.

Alleluiah or Alleluia (Heb.) 
Praise ye our Lord, used as a
sign of exultation. Paulus
Diaconus writes, that when
the Britains were invaded by
the Saxons and Picts, and on
a time ready to fight a battel
with them, they were admo­
nished by Germanus a French
Bishop (who was sent hither
with St Lupus, to confute the
Pelagian Heresie) that they
should say as he said, and
forthwith he cryed out aloud
Alleluiah, which when the
whole Army of Britains had
done, the sound thereof
strook such a terror into the
enemies, that they presently
fled, and the Britains had the
victory, De gestis Rom l. 15.
and Bede Eccl. Hist. l I. cap. 20. 
This Alleluia (saith a lear­
ned Author) is an Hebrew 
word, composed of Allelu and
Jah, whereof the Imperative
Mood Allelu (as neer as can
be uttered, for in it self it sig­
nifies joy behond all utter­
ance) is as much as praise ye ;
and the word Jah is one of the
ten names signifying our Lord,
which some think to be the
first word that children pro­
nounce, when they are new­
born. This word Alleluiah
the Jews do much esteem, and
pronounce it many times to­
gether in their Synagogues.

cause they wear great long
breeches.

two; so that words nicking
and resembling one the other,
are applyable to different sig­
nifications. As the Almigh­

Sara, that is, Lady or Dame.

called Acidus, and of late one 
called Scaliger Aliger: Cam­
dens Rem. fol 158.

Almanack (Hebr Alma­
nahh) a Prognostication or

the courses of the Moons of
the whole yeer, whereby they
could always certainly tell,
when the New and Full
Moons should happen, as also
their Festival days, and such
a carved stick they called an
Al-mon-aght, that is to say,
Al-mon-heed, to wit, the re­
gard or observation of all the
Moons, and hence is derived
the name Almanack. Verstegan

his grand-child Amalec (which
word is Heb. and signifies po­
pulus lambens, a licking people):
these Amalekites inhabited
some of the lands betwixt

of Israel, as they were travail­
ing betwixt the said Red Sea,

strictly observing all the parts
of the definition, are onely
bold with H, either in omit­
ing or retaining it, for that it
cannot challenge the right of
a letter, but the Licentiates,

they should prejudice poeti­ 
cal liberty, will pardon them­
selves for doubling or reject­
ing a letter, if the sense fall
aptly, and think it no injury
to use E for Æ, V for W, S for
Z, and C for K, and contrari­
wise.

is, that every Rent is going out
of Land, and an Annuity
goes out of no Land, but
charges onely the person of
the granter, or his heirs, that
have Assets by descent. The
second difference is, that for
the recovery of an Annuity,
no Action lies, but onely the
Writ of Annuity against the
Granter, his heirs or succes­
sors: but of a Rent the same
Actions lye, as do of Land, as
the case requires. The third
difference is, that an Annuity
is never taken for Assets, be­
cause it is no Free hold in
Law, nor shall be put in exe­
cution upon a Statute-Mer­
chant, Statute-Staple, or Ele­
git, as a Rent may. Doctor

and pestilent Heresie (hatched

which denyed the Son to be
consubstantial or of the same
substance with God the Fa­
ther, & asserted that he was a
creature made by God, capa­
ble of vice, &c. To beat
down which Heresie, the first
Council of Nice was called,
the Nicene Creed made, and
the Clause of one substance with
the Father, proved to be con­
sentaneous to the Word. To
subscribe the Decrees of this
Council, Arius was sent for,
by the Emperor Constantine;
To whom he went, having
written his own heretical Te­
nets, which he hid in his bo­
som, and reading before the 
Emperor the Decrees of the
Council, he wrote a Recantati­
on of his heresie, swearing
that he meant as he had
written; which words the
Emperor referred to the
Recantation, but he to the
paper of his own Tenets in
his bosom: when he had taken
this Oath, he went in tri­
umph through the streets of
the City, till a necessity of
nature enforcing him, he
withdrew aside to a house of
ease, where he voided out his
guts, and sent his soul as a
harbenger to the Devil, to pro­
vide room for his body. Heyl. 

This Heresie began about
the yeer of Christ 315. in
the time of Pope Silvester and
Constantine the great Emperor;
and notwithstanding, Arius
and his deceived complices,
were Excommunicated by
their own Bishop Alexander, up­
on the first broaching of their
Tenets, and that the heresie
was condemned by the afore­
said Council of Nice, and
thirdly, notwithstanding the
aforesaid suddain and infa­
mous death of the Author,
the heresie dyed not with 
him, but did afterwards much
spread it self (by the help of
Constantine the Emperor)
through all Christen­
dom, but more in the
East, then in the western
Church of God, nor is it to
this day quite extinct, divers
still adhering to it, especially
in Transilvania and the border­

Oceanus and Thetis, wife to Ia­
petus and mother to  Promethe­
us; It stretches in length

the world hath worn the Gar­
land of supereminency.
1 Because here man was
created, and put to Till the
Land.
2 Here our Saviour Christ
was born, wrought his Divine
Miracles, and suffered for our
salvation on the Cross.
3 Here were done the actions
memorized by the Holy Pen­
men of the Old and New­
Testament.

Monarchies of the Babylo­
nians, Assyrians, Persians
and Medes.

Aspect (aspectus)  behold­
ing or viewing, sight, pre­
sence or beauty. 

In Astronomy it signifies
the distance between the Pla­
nets and heavenly signes:
and there are four such A­
spects. The first, called a
Trine Aspect (because it di­
vides the Heavens into three
even parts) is the distance
of four signs from each o­
ther; As Aries beholds
Leo and Sagittarius with a
Trine Aspect, because these
are distant four signs, the 





one before, the other after
Aries . The second called a
Quartile, is the distance of
three signes, as Aries beholds
Cancer and Capricorn with a
Quartile Aspect, because they
are distant three signes from
him. The third called a
Sextile Aspect, is the distance
of two signes, As Aries be­
holds Gemini and Aquarius 
with this Sextile aspect, being
but two signes distant from
them. The fourth, called
an Opposite aspect is the far­
thest distance that can be,
namely a distance of sixe
signes asunder. As Aries 
beholds Libra, with this Op­
posite aspect, and Libra be­
holds Aries with the same.
The like is of all the other
Signes or Planets placed
in them. For example,
Taurus beholds Cancer and
Pisces, with a Sextile, Leo 
and Aquarius with a Quartile,
Virgo and Capricorn with
a Trine, and Scorpio with
an opposite Aspect. The
distance of one or five
Signes is not called an Aspect.

pleads, hath enough de­

collocare) is a word diversly
used in our Common Law.
Littleton, in the Chapter of
Rents, saith, it is æquivo­
cal, and sets down three
significations of it; one
as it is taken for a Writ ;
another as it is used for a
Jury ; the third as for an
Ordinance . 

But in Cowel you may
read more significations. I
shall onely give you this ad­
dition out of Sir Francis Ba­
cons Use of the Law, concern­
ing the General Assizes . All 
the Counties of this Realm
(saith he) are divided into
sixe Circuits, and two lear­
ned men are assigned by
the Kings Commission to
every Circuit, and to ride
twice a yeer through those
Shires allotted to that Cir­
cuit, these we call Justices
or Judges of Assize, who
have five several Commissi­
ons by which they sit. The
first is a Commission of Oyer
 and  Terminer, directed to
them and many others of the
best account in their Cir­
cuits, but in this Commissi­
on the Judges of Assize are
of the Quorum, so as with­
out them there can be no
proceeding. This Com­
mission gives them power to
deal with Treasons, Murthers
and all manner of Felonies
and Misdemeanors whatsoe­
ver, and this is the largest
Commission they have. The second is a Commission of
Gaole delivery . That is one­
ly to the Judges themselves,
and the Clerk of the Assize
associate: and by this Com­
mission they are to deal with
every prisoner in the Goale,
for what offence soever he be
there. The third Commissi­
on is directed to themselves
onely, and the Clerk of
Assize to take Assizes, by
which they are called Iustices
of Assize, and the office of
these Justices is to do right
upon Writs called Assizes,
brought before them by such 





as are wrongfully thrust out
of their Lands. The fourth
Commission, is to take Nisi
Prius directed to none but to
the Judges themselves & their
Clerks of Assizes, by which
they are called Justices of Nisi
prius . The fifth is a Commissi­
on of Peace in every County
of their Circuit. And all the
Justices of the Peace having
no lawful impediment, are
bound to be present at the As­
sizes to attend the Judges as
occasion shall fall out: if any
make default, the Judges may
set a Fine upon him at their
pleasure and discretions: the
Sheriff of every Shire is also
to attend in person, or by a
sufficient Deputy allowed by
the judges, who may Fine
him if he fail, &c. See more
of this in Sir Francis Bacons 
Use of the Law, fol.13.vsque

Astrology (astrologia) is a
Science which tels the Reasons
of the Stars and Planets moti­
ons. Astrology (sayes Doctor
Bullokar) doth promise by the
motion and influence of Stars
and Planets to foretel things
to come, or (as my Lo. Bac.
sayes) it professeth to disco­
ver the influence and domi­
nation of the superior Globe
over the inferior, and there­
fore may be tearmed a kind of
natural divination, so long as
it keeps it self in due limits,
and arrogates not too much
to its certainty; into which
excess if it once break forth,
it can then be no longer cal­
led natural Divination, but
superstitious and wicked; for
the Stars may incline, but
not impose a necessity in 





particular things.

seems to be very ancient, for
Josephus lib. I. Antiq. writes
that the Sons of Seth, Grand­
children to Adam, first found
it out; who hearing Adam
foretel the universal Flood,
which should shortly drown
the world, they thereupon
erected two great Pillars, en­
graving in them the Princi­
ples of Astronomy, the one
of which pillars was of brick,
the other of stone, that in case
the water should wash away
the brick, yet the stone might
preserve the knowledge here­
of for posterity. Bull. These
Pillars were called Enoch, or
 Enos Pillars . Zoroastes the
first King of Bactria (who
raigned in the time of the As­
syrian Monarch Ninus) is said
to have notably augmented
or perfected this Science.

count among the heathen Ro­
mans, insomuch that there
was a Colledge of them in the
City, neither would the Ro­
mans undertake any publick
matter of importance with
out asking their assent; But
the vanity hereof was well
derided by a wife Jew, na­
med Mossolamus, as Josephus
writes: For an Augur in the
Wars once requiring that the
Army which was then march­
ing, might stand still a while,
till he took observation of a
Bird, thereby to fore-know
the success of that Expediti­
on, this Jew (whilst the Au­
ger was busie in his art) shot at
the bird with an arrow, and
by chance killed her, whereat
the Augur and others being
highly offended; Are you so
foolish (quoth the Jew) to
imagine this poor Bird can
tel what will happen to us,
that could not foresee her
own death so neer at hand?
They were called Augures,
ab avium garritu, from the
chirping and chattering of
birds. The ægyptians were
the first inventers of this Dia­
bolical superstition.

to be so called, because it is
of more weight than the o­
ther. Also it signifies such
merchandize as are weighed
by this weight, and not by
Troy weight, as in the Statute
of York, an.9. E.3 in Proœm. an.

Babel (in Hebr. it signi­
fies confusion) was an ancient
City of Chaldea in Mesopota­
mia, famous for the confusi­
on of Languages, which
there happened: For immedi­
ately after the universal De­
luge, Nimrod the son of
Chus the son of Cham per­
swaded the people (as some
Authors surmise) to secure
themselves from the like dan­
ger by building some stupen­
dious Edifice, which might
resist the fury of a second De­
luge. This counsel was gene­
rally imbraced, Heber onely
and his family, contradicting
such an unlawful attempt;
the major part prevailing,
the Tower began to rear a
head of majesty 5164 paces
from the ground (says Isidore)
having its basis and circumfe­
rence equal to the height. But
God beholding from high this
fond attempt, sent amongst
them (who before were one
language) a confusion of 72
tongues, which hindred the
proceeding of this building,
one not being able to under­
stand what his fellow called
or 





Bring me (quoth one) a Trowel quickly quick,
One brings him up a hammer; here this brick
(Another bids) and then they cleave a Tree.
Make fast this rope, and then they let it flee:
One calls for Planks, another Morter lacks;
They bring the first a stone, the last an Axe. Du Bartas.

Thus being compelled
to desist from so unlucky an
enterprize, they greedily
sought out such as they could
understand, with whom con­
forting themselves, they for­
get their former acquaintance,
and now are divided into 72
different nations, comprehen­
ding about 24000 men, be­
sides women and children,

Q. Semiramis; it contained in
compass 60 miles, it had 100
gates, the walls were in height

foot, in breadth 75, and the ri­
ver Euphrates passing through
the midst of it. 1. part. of the

Hence it is we use Babelish for

large does not ebb and flow
are first, The narrowness of

ation of it, whereby the cœ­

Baptism (from the Gr. 
Βάπζισμα, id est a washing with
water, or diving over the
head) is one of the Sacra­
ments instituted by our Savi­
or Christ in remedy against
Original sin in the law of
Grace, as Circumcision was the
remedy against that sin in the
Law of Moses. Before Christs
institution of this Sacrament
John Baptist did baptize unto
penance, but his Baptism
was not a Sacrament. In Au­
thors you may read of three
sorts of Baptism, which Di­
vines call Baptismus fluminis,
of water, which is the already
mentioned; Baptismus flami­ 





nis, of the Spirit, which is
contrition of heart with de­
sire of the sacrament of Bap­
tism, And Baptismus sanguinis,
of blood, which is Martyrdom.
The custom of the Primitive
Church was to have God-Fa­
thers and God-Mothers in the
administration of the Sacra­
ment of Baptism; their Of­
fice was not onely to be Wit­

tized, but also to under­
take a charge of instructing
or seeing him instructed in

language a child would na­
turally speak, being brought
up among dumb people, or
where no speech should be
heard, to the end he might 





judge thereby, what was the
most ancient and natural lan­
guage; and did therefore
cause two children to be
nursed in a Forest, where
no voice of man could be
heard, after four yeers
were past, being brought
before the King they could
sometimes pronounce this
word Bec, whereupon
some gathered that Phrygi­
an was the first Language
of man. But (as St. Au­

might have learned the word
Bec (and so retained it)
of Goats, among which they
were nourished. For, as he
shews in his work of the

For the Canonists hold, that he
that has been twice marryed
may not be a Clerk; and they
ground it upon these words
of St Paul, I Tim.3.2. Opor­
tet ergo Episcopum irreprehensi­
bilem esse, & unius uxoris vi­
rum . And also him that hath
marryed a widow, they by in­
terpretation take to have been
twice marryed, and both
these they not onely exclude
from Holy Orders, but deny
all priviledges of Clergy;
but this Law is abolished by
 Anno 1 Ed.6 cap.12. And to
that may be added the Statute
of 18. Eliz. cap.7. which al­
lows to all men that can read
as Clerks, though not within

(as it is in the Authentical
Deed) purchased Hendon in
Middlesex of King Edgar to
Westminster for 200 Bizantines:
of what value they were, was
utterly forgotten in the time
of King Edw.3. for whereas
the Bishop of Norwich was
condemned to pay a Bizantine
of Gold to the Abbot of St.
Edmondsbury, for encroaching
upon his liberty (as it was en­
acted by Parliament in the
time of the Conquerour) no
man then living could tell
how much that was: so as it
was referred to the King to
rate how much he should pay:
which was the more strange,
considering, but 100 yeers be­
fore 200000 Bezants were ex­
acted of the Soldan, for re­
deeming St. Lewis of France,
which were then valued at
100000 livres. The name con­
tinues yet in the blazons of
Arms, where plates of gold

Cabala orCabalistick
Art, a hidden Science of
Divine Mysteries, which con­
sists in drawing several senses
either out of the same letters
of a Hebrew word, as they
lye first written in the word,
or by different combinations
of them, or by changing
one letter for another ac­
cording to art, or from the
different writing a letter in
one word, from the writing
of the same Letter in ano­
ther word, or yet by some
other nice ways, known to the
Hebrew Rabbins, who are they
onely that use this art
for their Exposition of Scrip­
ture; And as it is an Art
proper to the Jewes, so
is it judged by the better
learned to contain more of 





the imaginary, or phan­
tastical, then of solid lear­
ning, towards the true un­
derstanding of holy Scrip­
ture. 

Picus Mirandula describes
it shortly thus, Est nam­
que universa issa secretior Di­
vinæ legis expositio ex ore
Dei à Moyse accepta & Pro­
phetarum animis à Deo infu­
sa . It comprehends all
those secret waies of expo­
sition of the Divine Law,
which were received by Mo­
ses from the mouth of God,
and were afterward revea­
led by God to his Pro­
phets. 

And Camden saith thus of
it, "That (as the great
'Masters of the Jews testifie)
' Moses received of God a
'literal Law, written by
'the finger of God in the
'two Tables of the ten Com­
'mandements to be impar­
'ted to all, and another my­
'stical, to be communicated
'onely to seventy men, which
'by tradition they should
'pass to their posterity,
'whereof it was called Ca­
' bala which was divided into
' Mercana, or Merana, concer­
'ning onely the sacred names
'of God, and Bresith, or
' Bereseith, of other names,
'consisting of Alphabetary
'revolution, which they will
'have to be Anagrammatism,
'by which they say Mary re­
'solved, made our holy Mistris .
'But whether this Cabala is 
'more ancient then the Tal­
'mudical learning, hatched
'by the curious Jews (as some
'will) about 200 years after
'Christ, let the learned consi­
'der. Cam. 

Arithmancy, Theomancy and
Cosmology, are said to depend
on the aforesaid Cabala,
which (to give you also Reu­
clins definition of it) is no­
thing else but a kind of un­
written Theology; and that
therein is a much greater part
of beleef and speculation, then
of discipline.

that Country. They pay no
Subsidies; Suits at Law
are commenced and answer­

at their Coronation. And
for their greater Dignity,

who being in company of o­
thers, neither speaks nor acts
as they do. 

There is also a kind of wri­
ting which we call by Ci­

every exercised Statesman
hath peculiar to himself, and
which was invented by J Cæ­
sar, when he first began to

& was by him in his Letters
to his more private & rety­
red friends, used, that if by
misfortune they should be in­
tercepted, the contents of
them should not be under­
stood;  ne obvia literarum lectio
cuivis esset. Heyl.

specially for such as have per­
sonal conference with the Di­
vel or evil spirit, to know
any secret, or to effect any
purpose. An.5. Eliz. ca.16.
And the difference between
Conjuration and Witchcraft is,
that the Conjurer seems by
prayers and invocation of
Gods powerful names, to
compel the Devil to say or
do what he commands him:
The Witch deals rather by a
friendly and voluntary con­
ference or agreement between
him or her, & the Devil or Fa­
miliar, to have his or her turn
served for soul, blood, or other 
gift offered him: So that a
Conjurer compacts for curio­
sity to know secrets, and
work marvels; and the
Witch of meer malice to do
mischief. And both these
differ from Inchanters, or Sor­
cerers, because the former two
have personal conference
with the Devil, and the other
meddle but with Medicines,
& ceremonial forms of words
called Charmes, without
apparition. Minshew, and

Cycle (cyclus) a round or
circle. In Astronomy it is
thus defined. The division
of the yeer into 52 weeks, be­
cause it sets off one day super­
numerary, makes an alterati­
on in all the rest; so that the
days of the week (which
use to be assigned by the let­
ters of the Alphabet) fall 





not alike in several yeers; but
Sunday this yeer, must fall out
on the next yeers Munday,
and so forward till seven yeers
and (because the Bissexille
superads another day every
fourth yeer) till four times
seven, that is, 28 yeers be
gone about. This revolution
is called the Cycle of the Sun,
taking name from Sunday, the
letter whereof (called there­
fore Dominical) it appoints
for every yeer. It is found
by adding nine (for so far the
Circle was then gone about)
to the yeer of our Lord, and
dividing the whole by 28, so
to the yeer following 1639,
if nine be added, the numerus
factus will be 1648, which, di­
vided by 28, leaves 24 for the
Cycle of the Sun. 

The Cycle of the Moon is
the revolution of 19 yeers, in
which space (though not
precisely) the Lunations re­
cur. For because of the Sun
and Moons unequal motions,
the changes falling out in­
constantly; the time of con­
junction could not be still the
same. This variety the An­
cients perceiving to be peri­
odical, endeavoured to com­
prehend what Circle it made
in going about. The learned
Meton, finding the Revolution
was not compleated in less
time, then the space of 19
yeers, set forth his Ennedeca­
etris, within the Circle wher­
of the Lunations (though
not exactly) do indeed recur, 
so that if the quadrature of
the Moon shall fall out as this
day of this yeer, the like
shall return again, the same
day of the 19 yeer succeeding.
This Cycle is therefore called
Cyclus decennovennalis, and
from the Author Annus Me­
tonicus; from whose Athenians
the Egyptians may seem to
have received it, as the Romans
from them, in Letters of gold;
from whence (if not from the
more precious use of it) it
obtained to be called, as it still
is, the numerus aureus or Gol­
den number . It was made
Christian by the Fathers of
the Nicene-Council, as being
altogether necessary to the
finding out the Neomenia Pas­
chalis, upon which the Feast
of Easter, and all the move­
able rest depended. It self is
found by adding an unite to
the yeer of our Lord, and di­
viding the whole by 19, the
remainder shall be the Cycle
of the Moon; or if nothing
remain, the Cycle is out, that
is nineteen. Mr. Gregory, de
Æris & Epochis p.133.

of twenty four hours. The

is divers: for the Atheni­
ans began their day from Sun­
set, but the Jews, Chaldeans,
and Babylonians from Sun-rise,
the Egyptians and the Ro­
mans from midnight, of whom
we take our pattern to count
the hours from midnight, one, 





two, three, &c. The Umbri­
ans from noon. The parts

a Ceremony used by the Bi­
shops and Prelates in Cathe­
dral Churches and Religious

on that day at night after
his last supper, and before
his institution of the Bles­

Degree, A term often u­
sed in Astronomy and Phy­

nifies the thirtieth part of a

parts or degrees are all the
signs divided. In Physick it
signifies a proportion of heat,
or cold, moysture or dryness,
in the nature of simples; and
there are four such proporti­
ons or Degrees . The first
degree is so small, that it can
scarce be perceived. The 
second, that which may be
manifestly perceived without
hurting the sense. The third
that which somewhat offends
the sense. The fourth, which
so much offends, that it may
destroy the body. For ex­
ample, sweet Almonds, Rice,
Bugloss, ripe Grapes, are hot in
the first degree: Parsley,
Saffron, Honey, in the se­
cond degree: Cummin,
Galingal, Pepper, in the
third degree: And Garlick,
Spourge, Euphorbium in the
fourth degree. So Barley
is cold in the first degree,

there may be four degrees,
and in moisture but two. Bul.

the benefit of a superior
Lord. But this word is
now most commonly used
for a distinction between

of his Lessee; and such o­
ther Lands appertaining to

ving a Cart, and seeking to
redress any thing about it,
should so fall, as the Cart
wheel running over him,

themselves, and any of them

by the fall of the Tree. In
the first of these cases, the

and in the third, the Tree is to

Commanders in war, to no­

or design of their own. And
is the same which the Italians 
(and we also from them) call
an Imprese, wherein there is
required a correspondency of
the Picture, which is as the
body, and the Motto, which
(as the soul) gives it life.
That is, the body must be of
fair representation, and the
Motto in some different lan­
guage, witty, short, and an­
swerable thereto, neither too
obscure, nor too plain, and
most commended, when it is
an Hemistich, or parcel of a
verse; for example, one,
who, as triumphing over the
force of Venus, depainted 





her Son, winged Cupid, in a
net, with this Motto, Qui
capit, Capitur. Likewise the
needle in the Sea compass still
moving, but to the North­
point onely, with Moveor im­
motus, notified the respective
constancy of the bearer to one
onely.

There is a Tradition of a
Dilemma, that Bishop Morton
(Chancellor to H.7.) used, to
raise up the Benevolence to
higher rates, and some called
it his Fork, & some his Crotch ;
for he had concluded an Ar­
ticle in the Instructions to the
Commissioners, who were to
levy the Benevolence ; That if
they met with any that were spa­
ring, they should tell them, they
must needs have, because they laid
up; And if they were spenders,
they must needs have, because it
was seen in their port and man­
ner of living. L. Bac. Hen :7.

Divination (divinatio) a
presage or foretelling of
things to come; which may be
divided into three different
kinds (viz.) supernatural, na­
tural and superstitious. Su­
pernatural Divination (onely re­
vealed to man by God) is not 





properly called Divination,
but Prophecy, with which
all the holy Prophets have
in former times been inspired.
Natural Divination, may be
divided into two branches;
whereof the first is that
which hath in former times
been practised by wicked spi­
rits in Oracles and Answers
given by them in Idols, and
is at this day sometime seen
in possessed persons, who by
suggestion of the Devil may
foretel things to come, and
this is but a Natural Divinati­
on : For though to us it seem
miraculous, because of our
ignorance in the causes and
courses of things, yet in
those spirits it is but natural,
who by their long experience
and great observation, besides
the knowledge of secrets in
nature, and their quick in­
telligence from all places, are
able to fore-see much more,
then we by nature can. The
second Branch of Natural Di­
vination is that, which a wise
man may foretel by probable
conjecture, being no way of­
fensive, so long as it is onely
guided by reason, and over­
ruled by submitting it self to
the Almighty power of God.
And to this second kind of
Divination, Astrology may
also be referred which (by the
motion and influence of Stars
and Planets) promises to
foretel many things, so long
as it keeps it self in due limits
and arrogates not too much 
to the certainty thereof; in­
to which excess of vanity, if
it once break forth, it is then
no longer called natural Di­
vination, but superstitious and
wicked. For the Stars may
incline, but not impose a ne­
cessity in particular things.
The third and last manner of
Divination is that which we
call Superstitious, whereof
there has been among the
Gentiles divers different
kinds. As namely, Augury,
by the flying, feeding, and
chirping of Birds. Alphito­
mancy, by Barly meal. A­ 
ruspicy, by opening and view­
ing the bowels of Beasts.
Necromancy, by calling up De­
vils, or dead mens Ghosts,
Geomancy, by making cer­ 
tain circles and lines in the
earth. Hydromancy, by some
apparition in water. Pyro­
mancy, by the fire, or by spirits
appearing in the fire. Palmi­
stry or Chiromancy, by look­
ing on the lines of the fingers
and hands. Coscinomancy, by
a Sieve. Aeromancy, by the
Air. Capnomancy, by the fly­
ing of smoak. Catoptromancy,
by visions in a glass. Sorcery 
or Cleromancy, by lots. Ar­
momancy, by the shoulders of
beasts. Axiomancy, by Hatchets.
Daphnomancy, by a Lawrel or
Bay tree. Alectryomancy, by
a Cock. Alebromancy, by Bar­
ly meal mixed with Wheat.
Batanomancy, by vertue of
hearbs. Cephaleonomancy, by
an Asses head broiled on 





coals. Ceromantie, by wax
put into water. Lithomancy,
by a stone. Belomancy, by ar­
rows. Libanomancy, by In­
cense or Frankincense. Me­
topomancy, by the face. Ne­
cyomancy, by conference with
dead bodies raised, &c. 

All which being by the
Pagans themselves accounted
deceitful and vain, it remains
that of Christians they be
utterly rejected and abhor
red.

Divorce (divortium) the
dissolution of marriage, a se­
paration of man and Wife,
which was (as our Saviour
witnesseth, Matth.19.8.) first
permitted by Moses to the
Israelites, Deut.24.1. for the
hardness of their hearts, that
men might rather put their
Wives away, whom they
grew weary of, then use them
with too great extremity to
shorten their lives, as many
did; The woman so divor­
ced was to have of her Hus­
band a writing (asSt. Hierom
and Joseph, witness in l. de ant. 
4. c.8.) to this effect, I promise
that hereafter I will lay no claim
to thee, and this writing was
called a Bill of Divorce . But
with Christians this custom is
abrogated, saving onely in
case of Adultery. The anci­
ent Romans also had a custom
of Divorce, among whom it
was as lawful for the Wife to
put away her Husband, as for
the Husband to dismiss his
Wife; But among the Israelites 
this prerogative was onely
permitted to the Husband.

In our Common Law, Di­
vorce is accounted that sepa­

received all again that she
brought with her. This is
not but onely upon a nullity
of the marriage through some
essential impediment, as con­
sanguinity or affinity within
the degrees forbidden, pre­
contract, impotency, or such
like. See the new terms of

in any nearness to hinder
his light) cried out in a­

signifies an imperfect Syllo­
gism, which wants either the

As for example,

on.

Therefore every theft de­
serves correction.

Now if we leave out the
first part (called the ma­
jor) and say thus, Every
theft is a sin: Therefore e­
very theft deserves correction.
Or omit the second part (cal­
led the minor) and say Every
sin deserves correction; therefore
every theft deserves correction.
Then it is called an Enthy­ 





meme, to wit, a keeping in

properly signifieth) because

Epact (epacta) is nothing
else but a number of eleven
days, which the common So­
lar year, exceeds the com­
mon Lunar year, the one
consisting of 365 dayes, the 
other of 354 days, and there­
fore they add the excess unto
the Lunar year to coequal
them; For Epactæ comes
from ἐπάγειν, which signifies
 intercalare or addere; by the
addition of which excess in
every four years, there is got­
ten a number more then 30,
which is greater then the E­
pact can be, because from
Change to Change there can
be but Thirty daies; there­
fore Thirty must be taken
from that excess, and the re­
mainder is the Epact for the
next year, as 1656, the Epact
is Fourteen, to which adde 11,
which makes Twenty five,
which is the Epact for the
next yeer. 

To get the Epact for ever.
do thus: Multiply the Prime
by Eleven, parting the Pro­
duct by Thirty, and the Re­
mainder is the Epact; Or see
the age of the Moon, the E­
leven Kalends of April, for
that is the number of the E­
pact. Hop. Concord.

Jewes had several Epochs pe­
culiar to themselves alone,
and one in common with
their Neighbors; those which
they had among themselves
were, First, From the Crea­

Victory which Seleucus had
against Antigonus, in An. Mun.
3637. an account much used
by the Jews, Chaldeans, Syri­ 
ans, and other Nations of
the East. But the Chaldeans 
also had their own Epoch, or
account apart, reckoning
their time from the first
year of Nabonassar (Salma­

ture) which being 438
years before this of Seleu­

taining fifteen years, the
first beginning Ann. Christ.

gustus his Empire (being
that which is properly called
the Roman Æra) An. Mun.

began) till the reign of

his Dominions, An. Christ.
1350. followed therein by 





John the first of Castile,
An. Ch. 1383, and at last by
the King of Portugal also
1415. 

The Christians generally
reckon from the birth of
Christ, but this they did not
use till the year 600. follow­
ing in the mean time the ac­
count of the Empire. 

And finally, The Maho­ 
metans begin their Hegira 
(for so they call the time of
their computation) from
the flight of their Prophet
Mahomet from Mecha, when
he was driven thence by 
the Philarchæ ; which happened
16 July, An. 617, (or as some
will have it) 622. As the
word Epoch is used by the
Grecians, so in the same
sense is Æra by the Latins;

Felony (Felonia) seems
to come of the French Felon­
nie, id est impetuositas, atrositas,

degree next to petty Trea­
son, and compriseth divers
particulars under it, as
Murder, Theft, killing of a
mans self, Sodomy, Rape,
Wilful burning of houses, and
divers such like, which
are to be gathered, especial­
ly out of Statutes, whereby
many offences are dayly
made Felony, that before
were not. Felony is discern­
ed from lighter offences, by
this, that the punishment
thereof is death; Howbeit
Petit Larceny (which is the
stealing of any thing under
the value of twelve pence)
is Felony, as appears by Brook
tit. Coron. n.2. His reason is,
because the Indictment a­
gainst such a one must run
with these words, felonicè ce­
pit, and yet is this not punish­
ed by death, though it be loss
of goods. A man may call
that Felony, which is under
petit Treason, and punished
by death. And of this there
be two sorts: one lighter, that
for the first time may be relie­
ved by Clergy; another that
may not: and these are to be
known by the Statutes; for
Clergy is allowed where it
is not expressly taken away.

of St, Peter ad vincula, which
was wont and is still, within
the limits of the Roman Ca­
tholick Church, celebrated
upon the very Calends of Au­
gust . It is by some conjectured

throat. The reason of this
conjecture is in Durands ratio­
nali divinor. l.7. ca. de festo

That one Quirinus a Tribune,
having a daughter who had a
disease in her throat, went to
Alexander then Pope of Rome,
the sixth from St. Peter, and
desired of him to borrow or
see the chains that St. Peter
was chained with under Nero:
which request obtained, his
said daughter kissing the said
Chain, was cured of her dis­
ease, and Quirinus, with his
family were baptized. Tunc
dictus Alexander Papa (saith
Durand) hoc festum in Calen­
dis Augusti celebrandum insti­
tuit, & in honorem beati Pe­
tri Ecclesiam in urbe fabricavit,
ubi vincula ipsa reposuit, & ad
vincula nominavit, & Calendis
Augusti dedicavit. In qua festi­
vitate, populus illic ipsa vincula
hodiè osculatur . So that this

on is to denounce War,
to proclaim Peace, or to

with us is described by Po­
lydore lib.19. thus,  Habent
insuper apparitores ministros,
quos Heraldos dicunt; quorum

shal all the solemnities at the
Coronations of Princes, ma­
nage Combats, and such

same use of them with us, and
with the French Nation. See
Lupanus cap. Heraldi. With us
the three chief, are called
Kings at Arms ; and of them
Garter is the principal, insti­
tuted and created by Henry
the fifth. Stowes Annals, p
584. whose Office is to at­
tend the Knights of the Gar­
ter at their solemnities, and

belonged to the Duke of Cla­
rence, a King at Arms, and
called him Clarentius; His

pose the Funerals of Knights,
Esquiers, &c. through the
Realm on the South side of
Trent. The third is Norroy or
Northroy ; whose Office is the
same on the North side of
Trent, as that of Clarentius on
the South, as may well ap­
pear by his name, signifying
the Northern King, or King of
the North parts. Besides these
there be six others, properly
called Heralds, according to
their original, as they were
created to attend Dukes, &c.
in Marshal Executions; (viz.)
York, Lancaster, Somerset, Rich­
mond, Chester, Windsor. Lastly,
There be four others called
Marshals or Pursuivants at
Arms reckoned after a sort in
the number of Heralds, and
commonly succeed in the
place of the Heralds, as they
die, or are preferred, and those
are Blew-mantle, Rouge-cross,
Rougedragon, &  Percullis . Min.

But Verstegan says that He­
ralt comes from the ancient
TeutonickHere-healt, and
signifies the Champion of the
Army, or a most couragious
person. p. 251. Mr. Stow in

might be possible.

in the state of lapsed nature,

cient. 

4. The Semipelagians did
admit the necessity of interi­
or preventing Grace to every

written upon the Bill, where­
by any crime is offered to

they mislike their evidence, as

written is, that all farther in­

Julio, an Italian Coyn, of
value with us about six pence,
so called, because it was first
made by Pope Julius.

Julius ( Gr.) soft-haired or
mossie-bearded, so it signifies
in Greek. It was the name
of Ænea' s son, who was first
called Ilus. 

Ilus erat dum res stetit Ilia regno . 

The old English-men in the
North parts turned Julius into
Joly, and the unlearned
Scribes of that time may seem
to have turned Julianus into
Jolanus, for that name often
occurs in old Evidences.
Cam

July (Julius) this moneth
was called July in honor of
Julius Cæsar, the Dictator, be­
ing before called Quintilis or
the fifth month from March ;
which according to Romulus,
was the beginning of the yeer.
It was so called, either be­
cause Julius Cæsar was 
born in that month, or because
he triumphed in that month,
after his Naval victory over
Cleopatra Queen of Ægypt, and
her husband Antony.

Julian Account, so called
from Julius Cæsar, who, 44
yeers before the birth of
Christ, observing the falseness
of the account then in use, or­
dained the yeer to consist of
365 days and six hours, which
six hours in four yeers made
24 hours or a day civil, and
were added to the end of Fe­
bruary ; by reason whereof e­
very fourth yeer contained 





366 days, and was called An­
nus Bissextilis, the Bissextile or
leap-year, because the sixth of
the Calends of March was
twice written, and the thing
it self was called Intercalation .
This Account for many yeers
seemed to have no sensible er­
ror, yet in progress of time it
was discovered to be not so
exactly agreeable with the na­
tural motion of the Sun; For
the Julian yeer exceeding the
true Solar yeer 10 min. and
48 seconds, caused the Equi­
noxes and Solstices yeerly to
change their places and flye
back so many minutes and se­
conds. Whereupon Pope
Gregory the thirteenth by the
advice and direction of Anto­
nius Lilius and other excellent
Mathematicians, in the yeer of
Christ 1582 corrected the Ca­
lender, making the yeer to
consist of 365 days, 5 hours,
49 m.12 s. And that the vernal
Equinox, which then was on
the 11 of March, might be re­
duced to the 21 of March, as
it was at the time of the first
Nicene Council ; he commanded
10 days in the month October,
viz. from the 4 to the 14, to be
left out, so as the fourth day of
the month was accounted for
the 14 day. Hence it comes to
pass, that the new, forraign
Lilian or Gregorian account is
always 10 days before the old,
the English or Julian account.

as is sufficient yearly to main­
tain a Knight, with conveni­
ent Revenue, which in Hen. the
thirds days was but 15 l. Cam. 
Brit. p.111. or 680 acres of
Land, or 800 acres, eodem.
But Sir Thomas Smith in his
Repub. Angl. l. I. ca.18. rates
it at 40 l. And I find in the
Statute for Knights, An.1.
Ed.2. cap. I. that such as
had twenty pound in Fee, or
for term of life per an. might
be compelled to be Knights;
Stow. in his Annals, p.285.
saith, There were found in
England at the time of the
Conqueror 60211 Knights
Fees: Others say 60215,
whereof the religious houses
before their suppression were
possessed of 28015. 

Knights Fee, is sometime
used for the Rent that a
Knight payes for his Fee to
the Lord of whom he holds;
And this an uncertain sum,
some holding by forty shillings
the Shield, some by twenty
shillings, as appears by
Bracton lib.5. Tract. prim.

break up in a year: Releef
the fourth part of the annual

Labyrinths, whereof there

Howbeit Dion Chrysostome
saith, that there are certain
living creatures, or wilde
beasts inhabiting the utmost
and desert places of Africk,
which from the face to the
navel, were excellently beau­
tiful, and their fashion was to
lay open their Alabaster necks
and breasts to the view of
men, that so they might al­
lure and draw them near, and
often would they forth­
with devoure them. And
to this purpose the Prophet
Jeremy saith, The Lamiæ have 
discovered and drawn forth their
brests, and shewn their dugs,
Lam.4. The Hebrew Doctors
interpret them Devils of the
Desert, in expounding that
word of Isay, Tsijim (Isa.13.)
that it should signifie Lamiæ.
Tr. of Specters.

Lammas day, the first of
August, otherwise called the
Gule orYule of August, which
may be a corruption of the
Brittish word Gwyl Awst,
signifying the Feast of August ;
or may come from Vincula,
that day being called in La­
tin Festum St. Petri ad vincu­
la. It is called Lammas day,
because on that day after
Mass, the Priests in former
times were wont to begin to
gather their Tithe Lambs.
But Doctor Hammond, in his
Resolution to six Queries, 





pag.465. derives it from the
Saxon lafmess. id est e­
loaf-mass, or bread-mass; so
named, as a Feast of thanks­
giving to God for the first
fruits of the Corn, and seems
to have been observed with
bread of new wheat; and ac­
cordingly it is a usage in some
places for Tenants to be
bound to bring in wheat of

before the first of August . O­
thers say, It is a corruption

root of it is great and white 





like a Radish root, and is de­
vided into two or more parts,
growing sometimes like the
legs of a man. This root, e­
specially the bark of it, is
extreamly cold and dry, even
to the fourth degree. It is
therefore very dangerous to
receive inwardly, for that the
least quantity too much, will
quickly kill a man. Chyrur­
geons use to steep this root
in wine, and give it to be
drunk by such as they must
cut, saw, or burn in any part,
for its cold operation causeth
sleep, and maketh the body
insensible for a time. See

of a dew, white, and some­
what like Coriander seed;
with which the Israelites liv­
ed forty years in the Wil­
derness, till they came to
the Borders of the Land
of Canaan. At first sending
hereof the people were in
such admiration that they
said to each other, manhu? id est
 quid est hoc? what is this?
which seems to be the cause
why it was afterward called
Manna. In physick it is ta­
ken for a kind of dew, or
grained Manna, which, falling
in hot Countries upon trees
and hearbs before break of
day, doth there congeal, al­
most like crums of white
bread, and is gathered, and

forthwith, that Mansio Man­
sioni possit esse vicinata. I find
it most commonly used for
the Lords chief dwelling
house within his Fee, whe­
ther it have neighbors ad­
joyning or not, otherwise
called the capital Mesuage.
Bracton lib. 2. ca.26. or the
chief Mannor place. Mansio

Manslaughter (homici­

den occasion falling out, the
one kills the other. West par.

Masse, comes from the
Lat. missa, but whether missa
be derived from the Hebrew,
or be a Latin word corrupt­
ed, is no smal controversie;
They that derive it from the
Hebrew, conceive it comes
from הםס Missah, which
signifies an Oblation or Offer­
ing; They that account it to
be a Latin word corrupted,
conceive the Fathers used it
instead of missio a sending away:
For in ancient times when
the Mass or publick service
was ended; and the commu­
nicants addressed themselves
to be partakers of the holy
Eucharist, it was a custom to
send away the younger sort,
such as were not yet fully in­
structed and catechized;
Hence Missa was taken for,
and signified a Sacrifice, an
Oblation or Offering.

Messelto,Meseldine, or
Mistelden (from the Belg.
Mistel) a plant having slen­
der branches and green thick
leaves, and never grows upon
the ground, but upon other
trees; The best is that which
grows upon the Oake, its
leaves and fruit are good
to soften and ripen any cold
hard swellings. Of the ber­
ry of this vegetable, Birdlime
is made. But that the Thrush
eating these berries, and not
able to digest them, and so
from her inconverted muring
this plant should arise (as the

by Dr. Brown fo.98. From

did cack Misselto, which

sophus, incipit medicus, where
the Naturalist (for there the
word Philosopher stands for a
Phisiologer) ends, there the
Medicus begins: So as, if an
expert Leech, must needs be
skild in the Physicks (that is
in those speculations, which

the nearest word to fall with

the thing, was Physitian, for

andize by Sea, whereby they
(loth to hazzard their whole
adventure) give to some o­
ther a certain rate or propor­
tion, as ten in the hundred,
or such like, to secure the
safe arrival of the ship, and so
much wares at the place a­
greed on; So that, if the
ship and wares miscarry, the
Assurer makes good to the
venturer so much as he promi­
sed to secure, as 50.100. more
or less, and if the ship arrive
safely he gains that clearly,
which the Venturer com­
pounds to pay him; and for
the more even dealing be­
tween them in this case, there
is a certain Clerk or Officer or­
dain'd, to set down in writing
the sum of their agreement,
that they afterwards differ
not between themselves upon
the bargain. This term you

the Law of mercy, and upon

unto he grants such a Privi­
ledge. Of this you may read

But among all other Nati­
ons, the ancient Kings of
England seem to have attri­
buted most to those Sanctu­
aries, permitting them to
shelter such, as had com­
mitted both Felonies and
Treasons, so that within
Forty dayes they acknow­
ledged their fault, and sub­
mitted themselves to banish­
ment; During which time,
if any man expelled them,
if he were Lay, he was Ex­
communicated, if a Clark, he
was made irregular; But af­
ter Forty days no man might 
releeve them. See the New
Book of Entries verbo, Sanctu­

Synedrium ( Gr.) signifies
generally the place where
Counsellors meet to consult
of, and determine matters;
also the Assembly it self: But,
by an appropriation of the
word, it is commonly taken
onely for the highest Court of
Judicature, or supreme Coun­
cil of the Jews, which con­ 
sisted of one High Priest and se­
venty Seniors or Elders; from
which number, it was called
by them in Hebrew words,
signifying Domus judicit sep­
tuaginta unius, id est a Court of
seventy and one Judges; and
it was (as it were) their Par­
liament, to consult about, to
judge and decide the greatest
matters that could arise in
their Ecclesiastical or Civil
Commonwealth; as, to de­
termine the Controversies
that might happen concern­
ing their High Priest, true
and false Prophets, differen­
ces betwixt Nation and Na­
tion, Tribe and Tribe, &c.
This High Court was first in­
stituted (God commanding

thefts, and the like; this they
called by words of their
Language, signifying, Domus
judicit trium virum, The Court
of three Judges. The other
consisted of twenty and three, 





and so was termed by words,
signifying Domus judicii viginti
trium, to whose Court be­
longed the Decision of weigh­
tier Sutes and capital Causes. 

these Courts were erected
in several places, according
to the exigence and commodi­
ty of their Country, whereas
their other supreme Court,
after their possession of the
Land of Promise, and the set­
tlement of their Common­
wealth, was onely held in
Jerusalem, Jews might appeal
from those inferior Courts, to
this; but from this there lay
no appeal. Four kindes of
death were in their power,
Stoning, Burning, Sword,
Strangling; and they fasted
all that day when they con­
demned any to death.

on the Table, &c. The other,
to such passages or gutters, as
carry water into the Sea or
River, in Lawyers Latine
called Sewera, An.6. H.6. ca.
5. And there are Commissi­
ons of Sewers usually granted

rising certain person, to see
Dreins and Ditches well kept
and maintained in the Marish

ter conveyance of the water
into the Sea, and preserving
the grass for food of Cattle.
This word is probably de­
rived from the Fr. (issue) an
issue or going forth, as if we 
should call them Issuers, be­
cause they give issue or pas­
sage to the water, &c. And
the Lat. word (suera) some­
times used in these Commis­
sions, is a competent reason
for this conjecture. See Fitz.
nat. br. in Oyer and Terminer.
I have heard of an old
French book containing the
Officers of the King of Eng­
lands Court, as it was ancient­
ly governed, wherein he,
whom we now call Sewer,
was called Asseour, which
comes from the Fr. (Asseoir)
to set, settle or place, wherein
his Office in setting down the
meat is well expressed. And
Sewer, as it signifies an Of­
ficer, is by Fleta Latined

Sterling, is the common
term or Epitheton for money 
currant in this Nation; which
thus took denomination;
In the time of Richard the
First, money coined in the
East part of Germany, be­
gan to be of special request
in England for its purity, and
was called Easterling money,
as all the Inhabitants of those
parts were called Easterlings,
and shortly after some of
that Country, skilful in Mint
matters and Allayes, were
sent for hither to bring the
coyn to perfection, which
since that time was called
from them Sterling, for Easter­
ling ; Not from Sterling or Stri­
veling in Scotland, not from a
Star, or the bird Starling, which
some dreampt to be stam­
ped on it; For in old Deeds,
they are always called Num­
mi Esterlingi ; which implied
as much as good and lawful

Moneta, among the Civili­

Tantalize. Poets feigne
Tantalus King of Phrygia to
have been the son of Jupiter
and the nymph Plota, and for
that he received the gods to
a banquet, and sod his own
son Pelops, and gave them
him to eat, Ceres only did
eat of the shoulder, the rest
forbearing that meat, yet
Pelops was restored to life
and received an ivory shoul­
der for his own; and also
for that Tantalus discovered
the secrets of the gods to
men; therefore is he said to
be tormented in hell thus;
He stands up to the chin in
a pleasant river, and a tree
of faire fruit hanging over
him, and yet is he alwayes
plagu'd with hunger and
thirst, for when he either
stoops down to drink, or rea­
ches out his hand to take an 
apple, they both so retire
that he cannot touch the one
or taste the other, therefore
he may be called Tantalus,
 quasi Ταλάντατον, id est infelicis­
simus. Hence to be tantali­
zed, is to be in the condition
of Tantalus, to be neer un­
to, or in  sight of some
happinesse or wished thing,
and yet not to be permitted
to enjoy it.

Templaries, or Knights
of the Temple (Templarii) 
certaine religious Christian­
souldiers dwelling about the
Temple at Hierusalem, and
therefore so called, whose of­
fice and vow was to defend
the Temple of Hierusalem and
holy Sepulchre, and to en­
tertain Christian stranges
that came thither for devoti­
on, to guard them in safe­
ty, when they went to visit
the places of the holy land:
Their habit was a white cloak
or upper garment with a red
crosse and a sword girt about
them, as you may see in
Mr. Dugdales Antiquities of
Warwickshire. This order was
instituted by Pope Gelatius
about the yeer of our Lord
1117. or 1120. After it had
flourished about two hundred
yeers, it was suppressed by
Clement the fifth. 

These Templars first founded
and built the Temples or Tem­
plars Inne in Fleetstreet, which
without controversie is the
most ancient of all the Innes
of Court, and though they
were divided into three seve­
ral Houses, that is the Inner
Temple, the Middle Temple, and
the Outward Temple (which
last is now converted into
Essex house) yet were they
at first all but one house; 





in which these Knights lived
in great honour and opulency
about one hundred yeares;
For they had many Castles,
Lordships and Seignories
belonging to them and their
order in many parts of Eng­
land; and the Master of this
Order was a Baron of this
Nation; their Church, yet
standing, was dedicated to the
service of God by Heraclius,
Patriarch of Hierusalem, Anno
Dom.1185. After the suppres­
sion of these Templars, their
lands were (by a general
Council held at Vienna) con­
ferred on the other more  an­
cient religious Knights of
the Order of Saint John of
Hierusalem, called also Joan­
nites, and after Knights of
Rhodes, and lastly of Malta,
where they live at this day. 
And this cannon of the Coun­
cel was confirmed to the
Knights of Saint John resi­
ding here in England by Act
of Parliament made 17. Edw.2.
In the reigne of Edw. the
third (after several noble
persons had in this interval
been tenants and occupants
of the Temple-Innes) certain
of the Reverend ancient Pro­
fessours of the Laws obtain­
ed a very large, or perpetual
Lease of this Temple, or of
two parts thereof, distin­
guished by the names of the
Middle and Inner Temple, from
the said Joannites (then re­
siding in their goodly house
called the Priory of Saint 
Johns of Hierusalem, neere
Smithfield) to pay yearly ten
pounds. 

These Knights Templars
bore for their Armes, A
Shield Argent, charged with a
crosse gules, and upon the
nombreil of it, a holy Lamb.
And Matth. Paris saith, on
their common seal was engra­
ven a horse with two men
riding on him. But the so­
ciety of the Inner Temple
have taken for their en­
signe or devise, A Pegasus or
flying horse, sable or gules,
upon a Shield Or. Stow. O­
ver the door of the Temple­
Church was this inscription
in ancient characters, remain­
ing legible till April 1656.
when the cloister was new
whited and this defaced.

differences between a Tragedy
and a Comedy are these;
First, in respect of the matter,
because a Tragedy treats of
exilements, murders, matters
of grief, &c. a Comedy of love­
toyes, merry fictions and pet­
ty matters; In a Tragedy the
greatest part of the actors are
Kings and Noble persons;
In a  Comedy, private persons
of meaner state and con­
dition. The subject of a Co­
medy is often feigned, but of
a Tragedy it is commonly
true and once really perform­
ed; The beginning of a
 Tragedy is calme and quiet,
the end fearful and turbu­
lent; but in a Comedy con­
trarily, the beginning is tur­
bulent, and the end calm.

life of grace; Venial sinne,

Vestals (Vestales Virgines) 
were certain Virgins among
the ancient Romans, consecra­
ted to the Goddess Vesta, and
therefore so named; they
were always chosen between
six and seven years of age, and
continued thirty years in
their Office; whereof the
first ten years they bestowed
in learning the Ceremonies
of their Order; the second,
in execution thereof, and the 
last ten in teaching others;
After it was lawful for them
to marry, if they would:
Their chief Office was to
keep fire continually burn­
ing in a round Temple at
Rome, in honor of Vesta; and
if it chanced to go out, they
were to renew it again with
no usual fire, but such as they
could get by art from the
Sun beams.

They were greatly honored
in the City, and had divers
priviledges; for they were
carried in Chariots, and the
chiefest Magistrates would do
reverence to them; they had
Officers going before them,
as the Consuls had, and if
they met any one, who was
led to be put to death, they
had authority to deliver him,
taking an oath that they came
not that way of purpose, but
by chance; they might also
make a Will, and dispose of
their Goods as they pleased;
but if any of them were
found to live unchaste, she was
openly carried with sad silence
to the Gate called Collina,
where, being put into a deep
pit, she was presently buried
alive. These Vestals were first
instituted by Numa Pompilius,
or (as some write) by Ro­
mulus.

Vicount alias Viscount
 (Vicecomes) signifies with us
as much as Sheriff . Between
which two words, I finde no
other difference; but that the
one comes from our Conque­
rors, the Normans, and the
other from our Ancestors,
the Saxons . Viscount also sig­
nifies a degree of Nobility
next to an Earl, which (as
Cam. Britan. pag.170. saith)
is an old name of Office, but
a new one of Dignity, never
heard of among us till Henry
the Sixth his days. But this
degree of honor is far more
ancient in other Countries.

A Vidame was originally
the Judge of a Bishops Tem­
poral Jurisdiction, or such an
Officer to him, as the Vicount
was to the Count or Earl, but
in process of time, of an
Officer, he became a Lord, by
altering his Office into a Fief,
held of the Bishoprick he
belonged to; so that even
to this day the Estate of all
Vidames depends of some Bi­
shoprick, or is annexed to
the Temporalities thereof,
and therefore they are no
better then Seigneurs Medio­
cres (as the French say)
though the first of that rank;
and in all other Priviledges
and Rights equal to Vicounts,
with some advantage of Cre­
dit, in respect of high Juris­
diction, which those have
usurped by degrees upon
their Earls; and these had at
the first, by the gift of their
Bishops.

Waif orWeif. The nine­
teenth Chapter of the Grand
Customary of Normandy, is
entituled (De choses gaites)
and Latined by the Interpre­
ter, De rebus vaivis, id est Of 
things waived, which are
there thus defined. Vaiva
sunt res, vel alia, quæ nullius
proprietati attributa, sine posses­
sionis reclamatione sunt inventa,
quæ usque ad Diem & annum
servanda sunt . This Weif or
things weived, are nothing
but things forsaken. The
Civilians call it Derelictum .
Bract. (lib. I. cap. 12 num.10)
reckons them inter res, quæ
sunt nullius, ea quæ pro waivio
habentur; sicut de averiis, ubi
non apparet dominus; where he
also saith, Quod olim fuerunt
inventoris de jure naturali, &
jam efficiuntur principis de jure
gentium . This is a Regality
and belongs to the King, ex­
cept it be challenged by the
owner within a year and a
day, as appears by Britton,
cap 17. Now the Kings in
their times have granted this,
and such like Prerogatives,
to Subjects within their Li­
berties and Fees; so that
Waifs, Estrays, Things Lost, are
the Lords of the Franchise,
where they are found, but
must first be cried and pub­
lished in Markets and Church­
es near about, or else the year
and day runs not to the pre­
judice of him that lost
them. 

Mr. Skene, De verborum
signif. verbo, Waif, saith Waif
is pecus vel animal abberrans,
which wanders and strays out
of the way from the known
Master, and being found by
any person within his bounds, 





must be by him proclaimed
sundry Market days, and in
the Parish Church, and with­
in the Sheriffdom; otherwise
the Detainer may be accused
of Theft, and it is lawful for
the owner to challenge the
Beast with in a year and a
day. 

The Expositor of Law Terms
also saith, Waif is when a
Thief has felloniously stoln
Goods, and being closely
pursued with Hue and Cry, or
else overcharged with the
burden or trouble of them,
for his ease or more speed,
flies away, and leaves the
Goods, or any part of them
behinde him; then the Kings
Officer, or the Reeve, or Bailiff
of the Lord of the Manor,
who has such Franchise of
Waif, may seize the Goods,
so waived, to the Lords use,
who may keep them, as his
own proper, except the
owner come with fresh Sute
after the Felon, and sue an
Appeal, or give in Evidence
against him at his Arraign­
ment upon the Indictment,
and he be attainted thereof,
&c. In which cases the first
owner shall have restitution
of his Goods, so stoln and
waived. Also if a man be pur­
sued with Hue and Cry, as a
Felon, and leave his own
Goods, &c. these shall be
taken as Goods waived and
forfeited, as if they had been
stoln. 

Waived also belongs to a 
Woman, that being sued in
Law, contemptuously refuseth
to appear, as the word Out­
lawed doth to a man: For
Women cannot be out-lawed,
because they are not sworn in
Leets to the King, nor to the
Law, as Men are: so that a
Man is said Out-lawed, or
without the Law, to which
he was sworn, and a Woman
waived. Terms of Law.

Waldenses, took name
from one Waldo of Lions in
France, about the twelfth
Century, and held, They
were not bound to make pro­
fession of their Faith, deni­
ed the real Presence, Purga­
tory, &c. And condemned
the eating of Flesh, Eggs,
and Milk, &c. See Rosses 
View, pag 223.

Wakes orCountrey
Feasts, were most usually
kept on the Sunday next after
that Saints day, to whom the
Parish Church was dedicated.
And these Feasts took Ori­
gin from a Letter written by
Gregory the Great to Mellitus
Abbot, sent into England, in
these words. It may therefore
be permitted them (the Eng­
lish) that in the Dedication days,
or other Solemn days of Martyrs,
they make them Bowers about the
Churches, and Feasting together,
after a good Religious sort, kill
their Oxen now to the refresh­
ing of themselves, to the praise
of God, and increase of Charity,
which before they were wont to
offer up in Sacrifice to the Divel, 





&c. Bede Eccles. Hist. cap.30.
And they may be called
Wakes, because on the Vigil
of those Feasts, people were
wont to watch and pray, or
to awake from sleep at the se­
veral Vigils of the night;
but now that Religious Cu­
stom is prophanely converted
into rude Sports, and Glut­
tonous Feasting for the most
part.

Walter (Germ. a mans
name, fromWaldher, for so

Warp (from the old Sax­
on, awarp or awurp) to
throw or cast; hence we still
say a board warps or casts;
and in some parts of England
we call a Moul, a Mould­
warp, which is as much as 
to say, a Cast-earth. Ver­
stegan.

Wassail orWassale on
Twelf-day at night, or on
New-years Eve. The Origin
in the words of Verstegan,
thus. 'Lady Rowena, Neece
'to Hingistus, King of the Sax­
'ons, as she was very beauti­
ful, so was she of a very
'comely deportment, and
' Hingistus, having invited
'King Vertiger to a supper, at
'his new built Castle, cal­
'led Thong-Castle, caused her
'after supper to come forth of
'her Chamber, into the Kings
'presence, with a Cup of
'Gold filled with Wine in
'her hand, and making, in
'very seemly manner, a low
'reverence to the King, said
'with a pleasing grace, and
'countenance in our ancient
'Saxon Language, Waes
'heal hlaford Eyning, which
'is, according to our present
'Speech, Be of health Lord
' King; for as (was) is our
'Verb of the preter-imperfect
'tence, signifying have been,
'so (Waes) being the same
'Verb in the Imperative
'Wood, and now pronoun­
'ced (was) is as much to
'say, as, Grow, be or become,
'andWaesheal, by corrupti­
'on of pronounciation after­
'wards became Wassaile. The
'King, not understanding
'what she said, demanded it
'of his Chamberlain, who was
'his Interpreter, and when
'he knew what it was, he 





'asked him, how he might
'answer her in her own Lan­
'guage; whereof being in­
formed, he said unto her
'Drinc heal, id est Drink health,
' &c. Verst. p.101. 

I have also heard another
(but less handsom) etymolo­
gy of this word Wassale, quasi,
Wash-ale ; because common
people do often, on those
nights, wash their throats
with Ale, the old Saxon 
liquor.

Waters of Shiloah, pro­
perly waters, which came
from a Fountain at the Root
of Mount Sion, and ran
through Jerusalem with a still
and quiet course. Therefore
in Nehemiah 2. it is called the
Dragon or Serpents Well, be­
cause the Waters of it crept
gently as a Serpent; but Fi­
guratively it denoted the
Promise of help to the men of
Jersalem, against the Kings of
Syria and Israel, from Gods
power alone (without hiring
Forein forces) to repel their
enemies. Isai 8.6. The wa­
ters of Shiloah, which run so
softly. See Psal.46. 4. Wil­

Watling street, is one of
the four ways, which the Ro­
mans are said to have made
here in England, and called
them, Consulares, Prætorias,
Militares, Publicas . This
Street is otherwise called
Werlam-street, and leads from
Dover, to London, Dunstable,
and so to Westchester. An. 
39 Eliz. cap.2. The second
Street is called Ikenild-street,
beginning Ab Iconis, who were
the people inhabiting Norfolk,
Suffolk, and Cambridge-shire,
as Mr. Camden declares in his
Britan. pag 345. The third is
called Fosse, the reason of the
name he giveth, because he
thinketh it was ditched of
each side. The fourth is cal­
led Ermyn-street, &c. Of these
read more in the said Author.

Weald of Kent, is the
woody part of the Country.
Cam. Britan pag 247. Verste­
gan saith, ThatWald,Weald
andWold, differing in Vowel,
signifie one thing, to wit, a
Forest or Wood; for so the
(Teut.)Wald also signifies.
Yet I have observed that in
Leicester and York-shires those
places are now called Wolds,
which have little or no Wood
on them, but are rather a
Heathy, open, and campian
part of the Countrey; but
it is very probable those pla­
ces were formerly Woods
or Woody. In a very an­
cient Charter of the Ab­
bey of Garradon in Leicester­
shire, I finde Walda, as Latin
for Weald or Wold . From this
word Wald, came Waltham
Forest, anciently calledWald
ham forest. And VValde­
grave, (an ancient name in
Norfolk) took denomination 





from the disposing and over­
seeing the Forrest, for so much
the name imports.

Wea-bit orWay-bit, is a
word used in the North of
England, where if you ask how
far tis to such a place, they
answer, a mile and a Way-bit,
by which is understood a
mile and vantage, or a mile
and better. I find it written
Wea-bit in Mr Cleavelands Po­
ems, but I should rather think
it Way-bit; quasi, a bit or part of
a way.

Weapon Salve, is that
by which a wounded person
is said to be cured, by apply­
ing it to the sword or weapon
that made the wound; and
was first found out by Para­

tons Paradoxes, p. 1.

Wedding (nuptiæ) comes
from the Germ. [wed] id est pig­

Scotland signifies so much at

Weigh, is a certain weight
of Cheese or Wool, containing
256 pounds of Avoyr de pois .
And in some parts of this
land it signifies a certain
quantity of corn (most com­
monly of Barly or Malt) con­
taining six Quarters, or forty
eight Strikes.

Weights (pondera) there
are two sorts of them in use
with us; the one called Troy
weight, which has Twelve
ounces in the pound, and by
this, Pearl, precious Stones,
Electuaries, or Medicinal 
things, gold, silver and bread
are weighed; the other Avoir
du pois, which contains sixteen
ounces in the pound; by
this all other things are
weighed that pass between
man and man by weight, sav­
ing onely those above named.
Why the one should be called
Troy weight, I have not lear­
ned, though I read it libram &
unciam Trojanam, as if it came
from Troy: The other seems
to be so termed by reason of
the more full weight; for A­
voir du pois in French is as
much as to say, to have good
weight; but by these words
Avoir du pois are sometimes
signified such merchandize as
are bought and sold by this
kind of weight. Fleta lib.
2. cap.12. saith, Fifteen ounces
make the merchants pound;
which 'tis like, though an
ounce less, should be all one
in signification with the
pound Avoir du pois, and the
other pound, called by Fleta,
Trone weight, plainly appears
to be all one with that, which
we call Troy weight . And I
find not Troy weight mention­
ed by any other that ever I
read upon this subject, but
onely our own Countrimen.
See Tronage. One Phidon an
Argive is said to have been
the first finder out of Weights
and Measures. See Ounce and

Welch, the people of Wales,

lish, called them Wallish, and
by abbreviation Walch  or
Welch. Verst. p.120.

Were-wulf or Were-wolf 
(were in the old Sax. was
sometimes used for man) this
name remains still known in
the Teutonick, and is as much
as to say Man-wolf ; which is
a certain Sorcerer, who having
annointed his body with an
Ointment, made by instinct
of the Devil, and putting on
a certain inchanted Girdle,
does not onely to the view of
others, seem as a Wolf, but to
his own thinking, hath both
the shape and nature of a Wolf,
so long as he wears the said
Girdle, and accordingly wor­
ries and kills humane crea­
tures. Of these sundry have
been taken in Germany, and
the Neatherlands. One Peter
Stump, for being a Were-wolf
and having killed Thirteen
Children, Two Women, and
One man, was at Bedhur, not
far from Cullen, in the year
1859, put to a very terrible
death. Verst.

Wharf (from the Belg.
Werf, idem) is a broad plain
place near a Creek or Hithe

Whitsunday,Pentecost,
Whitsontide (id est albi solis tem­
pus) is a solemn Feast in memo­
ry and honor of the coming
of the Holy Ghost upon the
heads of the Apostles, in
tongues, as it were, of fire.
( Act.2.3) Pentecost in Greek
signifies the fiftieth, it being
the fiftieth day after the Re­
surrection. It is also called
Whitesunday, from the Catechu­
mens, who were clothed in
white, and admitted on the
Eve of this Feast to the Sa­
crament of Baptism. 





Verstegan says it was anci­
ently called Wied Sunday,
id est sacred Sunday; for wied or
wihed signifies sacred in the
old Saxon.

Whorlebat (cæstus) is
a Weapon with Plummets

mans.

Whole-chase Boots, are
whole hunting, or large ri­
ding Boots; and Demichase,
are, with the French, half hun­
ting, or (as we call them)
Summer riding Boots; though
some of our Shoomakers do
ignorantly apply the word De­
mi-chase to a certain colour of
the leather.

Wildfire (what it is, is well
enough known) was in­

it is most commonly taken

Winefrid, if Saxon, sig­
nifies win or get peace; but
some conceive it to be a Brit­
tish word, corrupted from
Gwen Brewa. Brewa
was the Saints name at first,
but had the additionGwen
(which signifies white in the
Feminine Gender) from the
white circle that remained in
her neck, after she was revi­
ved by Benno, the Priest, (as
the story goes) by joyning
her cut off head, to her dead
body. For it is a Tradition
among the Britans, that in the
very place where her head
was cut off by wicked Cra­
dacus, there sprung the Well
that has to this day conti­
nued under the name of St.
Winefrids Well in Flintshire;
by some esteemed to be the
most plentiful and miraculous
Spring in the world. Cam. in
part.

Winfrid,  i. e. An Ob­
tainer of Concord, or a
Win-peace; for so it signi­
fies in the old Saxon. An
English man of that name,
was by means of Charls the
Great, made Arch-Bishop
of Magunce, by Pope Gre­
gory the Second, and was
afterwards called Boniface;
he is accounted an Apostle of 





Germany, for his preaching
and converting much people
to the Christian Faith in
Saxony, and thereabouts. At
Doccum in Friezland, hath
been reserved unto our time,

all written with his own
hand. Verst.

Wisard (perhaps from the
Sax.Witega, id est a Prophet
or Foreteller of things to
come) or cunning man, the
Hebrews describe him thus;
he put in his mouth the bone
of a Bird and burned Incense,
and did other things, till he
fell down with shame, and
spake with his mouth, things
that were to come to pass.
We commonly take him for a
kinde of Witch, or one that

Wiseacre (from the Belg. 
Waerseggher, exWaer, id est

use it in malam partem, for a
Fool.

Wisemen of Greece were

Witch, is derived from the
Dutch Witchelen or Wiiche­
len, which properly signifies
whinnying or neighing like a
Horse; also to foretel or pro­
phecy; and Wiicheler signi­
fies a Southsayer; for that
the Germans (from whom our
Ancestors the Saxons usually
descended) did principally
(as Tacitus tells us) divine 
and foretel things to come by
the whinnying and neighing
of their Horses; hinitu &
fremitu, are his words. For
the definition, Mr. Perkins
( cap. I.) saith, Witchcraft is
an art serving for the working of
wonders, by the assistance of the
Divels, so far as God will per­
mit . Delrio defines it to be,
An art, which by the power of a
contract, entred into with the
Divel, some wonders are
wrought, which pass the com­
mon understanding of men . Lib. 
I. cap. 2. de Mag. Disq.

Wittal, is a Cuckold that
wits all, or knows all; that
is, knows himself to be a

is the last man in the Parish,

Woden, among the old
Saxons was honored for their
God of Battel; the word
signifies Fire or Furious.
Hence we say, when one is in
great rage, that he is Wood ;
and hence we call Wednesday 
instead of Wodnesday, on which
day he was chiefly honored.
See Verst.59.

buy Wool abroad in the
Country of the Sheepmasters,
and carry it on horse-back to
the Clothiers, or Market
Towns to sell again.

Woolstaple.  See Staple.

Woolwinders, are such as
winde up Fleeces of Wool,
to be pack'd and sold by
weight, into a kinde of bun­
dle, after it is cleansed, in
such manner as it ought to be
by Statute. And to avoid
such deceipt, as the owners
were wont to use, by thrust­
ing in Locks of refuse Wool,
and such other dross to gain
weight, they are sworn to
perform that Office truly be­
tween the owner and the
Merchant. See the Statute of
8 Hen.6. cap.22. and 23 H.8.
cap.17. And 18 Eliz. cap.25.

Wreck (from the Fr. Va­
rech) is where a Ship perishes
at Sea, and no man escapes a­
live out of it; the Civilians
call it Naufragium . This
Wreck being made, the goods 
that were in any part of the
Ship (being brought to Land
by the waves) belong to the
King by his Prerogative, or
to him to whom the King
has granted this priviledge.
An. 17 Edw.2. cap. II. But if
any person in the Ship come
to Land, it is no Wreck, no, if
either Dog or Cat escape a­
live, the goods are the own­
ners still, so he come within a
year and a day to claim them.
And for this the Statute is
plain, Westm. I. cap.4. An.

Rome made no advantage of

 YArdland (virgata terræ) 
is a quantity of Land so
called from the Sax. (Gyrd­
lander) but not so certain a
quantity, as that it is the same
in all places; for in some
Countries it contains twenty
acres, in some twenty four,
in some thirty, according to
Mr. Lambert, in his Explica­
tion of Saxon words, Verbo, 
Virgata terræ: This Yardland
Bracton calls Virgatam Terræ
( Lib 2. cap.10. & 27.) but
he expresseth no certainty
what it contains. 

Mr. Noy in his Compleat
Lawyer, pag.57. saith, That
two Fardels of Land make
a Nook of Land, and four
Nooks make a Yardland, and
four Yardlands make a Hyde

say eight) Hides make a
Knights Fee, the relief wherof

Year (annus) was divided
by Julius Cæsar into twelve
moneths, fifty two weeks,
three hundred sixty and
five days, and six hours,
wanting eleven minutes,
which odde six hours, every
Leap or Fourth year, make
the odde day in February .
The moneth is the twelfth
part of the Solary year, the
week is near the fourth part
of the moneth; the natural
week day, a seventh part of
the week, the Quadrant the
fourth part of the day, the
hour the sixth part of the
Quadrant, the Point the
fourth part of the hour; the

Danish words (Young Men)

words, Sunt sub quolibet horum

bus, quos Angli (Leges­

(Young Men) vocant, locati,
qui curam & onus, tum viridis
tum veneris suscipiant . These

Sir Thomas Smith in his Re­
pub. Angl. lib. I. cap.23. calls
him a Yoman, whom our Laws
call Legalem hominem, which
(says he) is in English a Free­
man born, that may dispend of
his own Free-land, in yearly
revenue, to the value of forty
shillings sterling; and writes
a discourse touching their
estate and use in this Com­
monwealth: The former E­
tymology of the name he
likes not, making question,
whether it comes of the
Dutch (Yoncker) or not,
which in the Low-Countries
signifies a mean Gentleman,
or a Gay-fellow; but he
that hath added the Margi­
nal Notes to that Book,
seems to draw it from the
Saxon (Geman) which sig­
nifies a married man. 

Verstegan (cap.10.) saith,(Gemen) among the ancient
Teutonicks, and (Germein)
among the modern, signifies
as much as Common, and
that the first letter G. is in
this word, as in many others,
turned into Y, and so written
Yemen, and that therefore
Yemen or Yeomen signifies
Commoner . 

Yoman signifies an Officer
in the Kings House, who is in
the middle place, between
the Serjeant and the Groom;
As, Yoman of the Chaundry, 
and Yoman of the Scullery, An.

bite or carp at other mens
works are called Zoilists.

Zone (zona) a Girdle; In
Cosmography it signifies a di­
vision made of the Heavens
into five parts, whereof one is
extream hot, two extream
cold, and two temperate.
The hot or torrid Zone, is all
that part of the Heavens,
which is contained between
the two Tropicks of Cancer 
and Capricorn, in which Zone
the Sun continually keeps his
course. The two cold or fri­
ged Zones are situate between
the two Polar Circles, and the
very Poles, continually want­
ing the neighborhood of the 





Sun; The two temperate Zones
are betwixt the Tropicks of
Cancer and the Artick, and be­
twixt the Tropick of Capricorn,
and the Antartick Circles, en­
joyning an indifferency be­
tween heat and cold; So 
that the parts next the torrid 
Zone are the hotter, and the
parts next the frigid Zone are
the colder. These five Zones
are disposed according to the
order of the five Zones in
Heaven. 

Ovid. 

 Utque duæ dextra Cœlum, totidemque sinistra
Parte secant zonæ, quinta est ardentior illis:
Sic onus inclusum numero distinxit eodem
Cura Dei, totidemque plagæ tellure premuntur.
Quarum quæ media est, non est habitabilis æstu;
Nix tegit alta duas; totidem inter utramque locavit
Temperiemque dedit mistá cum rigore flamma . 

Zone also signifies a Soul­
diers Belt or Marriage Girdle;
the Souldiers Belt was lined
in the inside, where, when

Young Maids when they
were married, were wont to
