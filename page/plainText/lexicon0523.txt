The Literal Figures, as I, II, V, &c. denote
the order of the Differences
under each Genus; and the other Figures, the order of the
Species under each Difference. So the word Sheep in
the Dictio­
nary is marked Be. II.2. The meaning of which is, That the thing
signified by that word is described in the Philosophical Tables under 
the Genus of BEAST, the second difference, and the second Species. 
And Goat is Be. II.2. Affinis. (i.e.) 'tis joyned as an Affinis to the same 
Species.

The Design of the Philosophical Tables is to enumerate and describe 
all kinds of Things and Notions: And the Design of this Dictionary, 
is to reckon up and explain all kinds of words, or names of things.

And that the Reader may the better understand the usefulness of 
having all words set down according to their different Acceptions, 
and by what kind of Analogy they come to be used in such various 
sences (which is one of the particular advantages of this Dictionary) 
I shall here select out of it one particular Instance, for each of these 
several kinds of words, viz. a Substantive, an Adjective, a Verb, a
Par­
ticle; by which it will be easie to understand any of the rest.

So the word CORRVPTION, according to that Notion of it which 
is

Primary and proper, doth denote theBeing, or Making of a thing,
evil, or worse, whether by
Admixtion with that which is bad, and then it is of the same 
importance with the word Defiling.
Privation, as to a thing
Being, so corruption is destroying.
Vsefulness, so corruption is spoiling.
Secondary, as applied to things
Natural, so Corruption will denote according to the Degree 
of it, either Infection, or Decay, or Putrefaction.
Moral, whether more
General, so it denotes the Evilness of the mind or manners, 
Vnholiness, Viciousness.
Special, so 'tis peculiarly applied to Vnchastity and Bribery.



So the word CLEAR, may signifie either
Entire of it self; so clearly is wholly.
Not mingled with others; so Clear is Simple. 
specially not with worse; so Clear is Pure.
Being free from impediments, or not being hindered from
Being, doing, or receiving, which notion of Clear may 
be often exprest by the Transcendental mark of Perfe­
ctive. There may be Instances of it given in every Ge­
nus; as particularly,
Quality, whether
Natural Power, so a clear sight or understanding is 
a good s. or u. It is applied to the
Mind, as a clear Wit, or Spirit.
Body, so we say one is clear of sickness or pain, has 
a clear skin, &c.
Habit, as a clear Reputation, that is a good R. 
sp. Sagacity and Sincerity are thus called Clear­
ness.
Manners, as Clear Dealing, that is Candor or Frank­
ness.
Sensible Quality.
Visible, as clear weather, or sky or water, &c.
Audible, as clear sound.
Sickness, as clear of any disease (i. e.) not Infected, 
or not Diseased.
Relation.
Civil, as a Clear Estate.
Judicial, as Clear of any Crime.
Military, as Clear Coast.
Ecclesiastic, as Clear of any Censure.
Being Done, so Clear is Easie, or not difficult; Being Known, 
so Clear is Plain or manifest; Being come to, or Passed 
through, so Clear is Accessible, or Passable, or Empty.

So the word DELIVER, according to its primary sence, is the mo­
tion (Met.) or the passing of a thing, or of the Possession of it, or of
the Power over it, from one to another. It is commonly used in rela­
tion either to the 
Subject, or thing deliver'd, whether
Things; so Deliver may signifie Depositing, Paying, Resigning.
Words, as to the
Matter, whether concerning
Fact, so Delivering is Narration
Doctrine, so Delivering is Teaching
Manner, whether
Immediately by
Mouth, so to deliver, is to speak.
Pen, so to deliver, is to write
Mediately, so Delivering is Tradition
Terms of this motion, either from a



Better condition to a worse, being used
Passively, so Delivering is Dereliction
Actively, whether
Involuntary, so Delivering is yielding
Voluntary, so Delivering is Betraying
Worse condition to a better.
Temporal, whether by way of
Prevention, so Delivering is Preserving, or Causing to escape:
Remedy, from 
Captivity, so to deliver, is to Vncaptivate.
Bondage, so to deliver, is to Vnslave.
Prison, so to deliver, is to Vnimprison.
Danger of Child-birth, so to deliver, is the 
Active of Parturition.
Eternal, so delivering is Redemption.

So the Particle BY, is sometimes used in the sence of an
Integral, signifying the notion of Digression or Accessory, as on 
the by; and is of the same importance with such kind of Ne­
gatives, as not principal, not pertinent, not public, not ordi­
nary; as a By-way: And sometimes 'tis used to denote a
common speech implying something of contempt, as a By-­
word.
Preposition
Causal, 
Efficient, By such an Author.
Instrumental, Slain by the sword.
Final, or end, By reason of, &c.
Local or Temporal, being sometimes used in that same
sence with those other Prepositions.
Before, as, By God, (i.) before God.
At, as, Come by, (i.) obtain, or come at.
In, as, by day, (i.) in the day time.
Through, as, by such a street,(i.) through such a street.
Besides, as, by the mark, (i.) besides.
Adverbs denoting the Circumstance of Nearness, whether
Local. So By, or hard by, is near such a Place.
Temporal. So By and by, is nearness in Time, signifying 
future (dim.)



Besides those Phraseologies wherein the Particle is used to signifie 
the Manner of things, as, By the By, By the Great, By Retail, By it 
self, &c. Which Phrases are to be expressed by the Adverbs Neuter 
of Digression, Aggregate, Segregate, Solitary, &c. So those Forms of 
Speech, By course, By the day, or day by day, By degrees, By turns, 
House by House, Year by Year, &c. are to be expressed by the Adverbs 
of Course, Day, Degree, Turn, House, Year, with the Transcendental 
Note of Segregate.
