WILL in the first person, as I will walk, we will 
walk, expresses the intention or resolution of the 
person, along with the future event: In the second and 
third person, as, you will, he will, they will, it expresses 
the future action or event, without comprehending or 
excluding the volition. 



Shall in the first person, whether singular or plural, 
expresses the future action or event, without excluding 
or comprehending the intention or resolution. But in 
the second or third person, it marks a necessity, and com­
monly a necessity proceeding from the person who 
speaks; as, he shall walk, you shall repent it. 


THESE variations seem to have proceeded from a po- 
liteness in the English, who, in fpeaking to others or of 
others, made use of the term will, which implies voli­
tion, even where the event may be the subject of neces­
sity and constraint. And in speaking of themselves,
made use of the term, shall, which implies constraint,
even tho' the event may be the object of choice.


Wou'd and shou'd are conjunctive moods, subject to
the same rule ; only we may observe, that in a sen­
tence, where there is a condition exprest, and a conse­
quence of that condition, the former always requires





shou'd, and the latter wou'd, in the second and third per­
sons; as, if he shou'd fall, he wou'd break his leg, &c.


These is the plural of this; those of that. The for­
mer therefore expresses what is near. The latter what 
is more remote. As, in these lines of the duke of Buck­
ingham.


" Philosophers and poets vainly strove, 
" In ev'ry age, the lumpish mass to move. 
" But THOSE 'were pedants if compar'd with THESE, 
" Who knew not only to instruct but please. 


WHERE a relative is to follow, and the subject has 
not been mention'd immediately before, those is always 
requir'd. Those observations which he made. Those 
kingdoms which Alexander conquer'd.


IN the verbs, which end in t, or te, we frequently o­
mit ed in the preter-perfect and in the participle; as,
he operate, it was cultivate. Milton says, In thought
more elevate; but he is the only author, who uses that
expression.


Notice shou'd not be us'd as a verb. The proper
phrase is take notice. Yet I find lord Shaftesbury uses
notic'd, the participle: And unnotic'd is very common.


Hinder to do is Scotch. The English phrase is hinder
from doing. Yet Milton says, Hinder'd not Satan to
pervert the mind. Book IX.
