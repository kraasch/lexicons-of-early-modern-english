plucke some vp here & there / so that the other may proue
the better. And those that you plucke vp / set them in voyde
places. They shulde be sowen in the ende of Iuly and in
August. The best sauered Nauewes be they that be lon­
ge and streyght and not ouer great / nor braunches in the
rootes / but one streyght roote. Also of Nauewes maye
be made a passynge good meet with a lytell salte & vy­
neger / hony / and Mustarde / and with swete spyces / and
it may be made without spyces. Nauewes be hote in the
seconde degre / & they norysshe the moche / but they be harde
of degestyon. They make the flesshe softe and wyndy /
but lesse wyndy than rapes. Therfore whan ye sethe them
in water cast that water away / & sethe them in another
water / and so his harde substaunce is tempred by that / &
so meanely bytwene good and euyll they gedre nourys­
shynge / for they that be thus well sothen be not harde of
degestyen. They make one wyndy. And they make stop­
pynge of vaynes and of poores / but yet they be profyta­
ble yf they be sothen twyes / and bothe the waters to be
cast awaye / and they to be sothen in the thyrde with fatte
flesshe.
