.... But some errors are 
mine, and mine by more then translation. Are they in Grammer, or Ortographie? as easie for you 
to right, as me to be wrong; or in construction, as mis-attributing him, her, or it, to things alive, or 
dead, or newter; you may soone know my meaning, and eftsoones vse your mending: or are they in 
some vncouth termes; as entraine, conscientious, endeare, tarnish, comporte, efface, facilitate, am­
musing, debauching, regret, effort, emotion, and such like; if you like them not, take other most com­
monly set by them to expound them, since there they were set to make such likely French words fami­
liar with our English, which well may beare them. If any be capitall in sense mistaking, be I admo­





nished, and they shall be recanted ...

Florio in his translator's introduction brands all these terms as barbarous.
