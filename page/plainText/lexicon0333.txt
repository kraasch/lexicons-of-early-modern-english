An Abstract and exposition 
of all things Perteyninge
to the Practique of 
Nauigation:/

A

Aft or Abast
Is a sea terme properly vsed abord the
shipp to distinguish betwixt thinges done or placed 
fromwardes the Stemm towardes the Sterne of the 
shipp. As when they saye come aft goe aft, or the like: That
is goe Towardes the Sterne. Hale the sheate Aft: The
mast hanges Aft That is towardes the Sterne. A shott Raked
the shipp fore and Aft. That is came in before and went
out a Sterne Alsoe we vse to saye Abast the foremast Soe
that the word is not particularly lymitted to anie parte of 
the shipp: But from anie parte of the shipp hath 
relacion to anie thinge done or placed towardes the
Stearne in respect of anie that are towardes the 
Stemme: As for example when wee hoise our 
 yarde wee saye stretch forwardes the mayne halleÂ­
yarde whose place is abast the Mainemast And 
contrarywise Stretch aft the fore halliareswhich 
are placed before the Maine Mast but Abast the 
foremast. When shipps meete (or beinge in Consort)
desire to knowe how the Companie doth they vse to 
demand how they doe all fore and Aft The reason
whereof is for that the whole shipps company is
divided,  both in respect of their laboure & Commaundes 
into Two partes. The Boate swayne and all the Common
Saylors vnder his comaund to, be before the Maine 
Mast The Captaine master. Masters Mate 
Guners Quarter Masters Trumpeters &c. to bee
abast the Maine Mast:/






Aloofe
Is a terme used in Condinge a shipp, when 
goes vpon a Tacke, and is Commmonly spoken from 
the mouth of the Conder, to the Steeres man, when
he suffers the Shipp to fall off from the wynde
and doth not keepe her soe neere by a wynd as 
she maye well lye:/




Amaine
Is a terme used by the men of warre (and 
not by Merchant Men) when they encounte???FBlock???
a shipp for that implies asmuch to the other
as to bid him yield. Amaine is used in this same 
alsoe, when anie thinge is to be lett downe by a Tacke
into the hold or elsewhere or that a yard is to be loward
or the like; Then when they would haue it come downe
as fast as they came; They call Amainewhich is to lett
goe that parte of the Ropewhich they held before to lett 
it downe easilie and by degrees. It is alsoe an adiunct
to the greatest and cheifest of some parte of the 
shipp vizt The Maine mast the Maine saile the 
Maine Beame &c. In Men of warr wee vse Wauinge
Amainewhich is either with a bright sword or anie other
thinge to make a signe to them that they should 
strike their topp sailewhich Commmonly they doe 
either on the for topp or on the Poope, To strike 
amaine is to lett fall their Topsailes:






Anchor
The forme and generall vse of an Anchor is
comonly knowen. But the severall partes proporcions
distinccions and apellacions vnderstood by very fewe
but practised and experienced Seamen The 
Anchor doth consist of these severall partes. The Ringe
the Head the Eye the Nutt the shanke the Beame or Arme, the 
Flooke towhich belongeth astocke The proporcion wch
it holdes in it selfe is the shankewhich is thrise as longe
as one of the flookes, and halfe the beame. The 
pproporcion in respect of shippinge is To a shipp of 500
Tunnes wee allowe 2000 weight for his shanke Anchor 
the bigest shipp in Englandes Anchor is but 3300
The distinccions are  made by the vse according
to their proporcion they beare to the shipp in wch
they are imployed for thatwhich in one shipp would
be called but a kedger or kedg Anchorwhich by 
occation of their severall vses receive severall names
and appellacions are first a Kedgerwhich is the smalest
wch by reason of that lightnesse is fittest to stopp the shipp
in kedginge downe a River: The next a streame Anchor
wch wee vse in deepe waters to stopp a tyde wthall 
in faire weather The others they call by the name of
first second and Third Anchor. All these beinge 
such as the shipp may ride by in anie reasonable 
weather seagate or tyde. These are somewhat bigger
then another an other and usually when they saile in anie Straightes
or are meere a Port they carry two of these at the Bowe
wch is the couse they are alsoe called by the name of 
first Second and Third Bowers:/
The otherwhich is the biggest and thatwhich the Sea
men call their last hope and is neuer vsed but in 
greate extremitie is called the sheate Anchor 
this is the true Anchor a spei for this is their last
refuge. The Anchor is a Cocke bell when the 
Anchor hanges right vpp and downe by the shippes side
And there is appoynted by the Masters when they are
Ready to bringe the shipp to an Anchor Lett fall



the Anchor let it goe downe into the Sea The
Anchor is a Peake: That is when heaveinge vpp the
Anchor the Cable is right perpendiculer betwixt the
Hause and the Anchor The Anchor is fowle 
That is when the Cabell by the turninge of 
the Shipp is gott about the flookewhich will 
not only Cutt the Cabell asunder but make
the Anchore not to hold. And therefore when
ever we come to an Anchor where there is tyde
we laye out Two Anchors soe as that vpon
the turninge of the Tyde, The shipp wind vpp
cleere of either Anchor. Cleer the Anchor 
That is gett the Cabel off the Flooke: or 
generally when they lett fall the Anchor they
vse this terme to see that the Buoy Rope or 
noe other Ropes belonginge to the shipp doe
hang aboute it, Fetch or bringe home the 
Anchor, That is to way it in the Boate and
bringe it a bord the shipp. The Anchor comes
home That is when the shipp drives a waye 
wth the tyde or Sea, This may happen either
because the Anchor is to smale for the burthen
of the shipp or for that the ground may be too
soft and oozie In such places we vse to hewe
the AnchorThat is to putt Boordes of the
Flooke in the forme of the Flooke and make it
much broader then before. 
In Porto Ferrene by Tunis I sawe the 
experience of Tallowinge an anchore whenthe
ground beinge soe soft wee shodd our Anchors 
and yet they all come home, and the shipps



drave a ground, only anie shippwhich had an 
Anchor Tallowed road fast The reason 
I could never truly knowe but suppose that
it might because the Tallowe suncke deepe in 
the Ooze and found some harder ground at 
the bottom then the other, Boate the 
Anchor. That is putt it into the Boate:/




Anchoringe or 
Anchoridge
Is when we lett fall an Anchor or more into the 
Sea with Cabells to them soe that the shipp 
may ride fast by them wee saye there is good
Anchoringe when there is Shoule water for 
In deep waters, the Sea hath more force against 
a Ship, and the Anchors are very longe a wayinge
upon anie occasion: Ground that is not to soft 
or Oozie inwhich the Anchors can have noe-
fast hold Nor too hard and knotty soe that it
ride in is a Stiffe claye or a hard sand 
where they may ride out of the waye of the 
`tyde And lastly where they may ride Land-
Locked, soe as that the Sea gate can have noe
power against them: Towhich may be added that 
the Lee Shore on every side is soe soft, that if 
a shipp come aground she can catch no hurt 
or else that they may have Sea roome to sett
Sayle If their Cabells breake or their Anchor
comes home That placewhich hath all these 
Comodities is good to ride in and here we saye
is good Anchoringe or Anchorige Bad Anchor-
ing is in a place where all or many of that Contrary 
Conditions are to be found:




Anchor stocke
Is a peece of Tymber fitly wrought and 



 fastened at the Nuttes crossinge the flookes
the use whereof is to guyde the Anchor vpon 
the ground that one of the flookes may be sure
to fasten in the ground wthoutwhich the Anchor
would lye flatt vpon both the flookes, and take
noe holde. The proporcion whereof is usually 
taken from the length of the Shancke:/




Arme
This is not used as a word of Allarum att 
Sea as it is a land: for att Sea, wee oft vse to saye
make readie the shippwhich implies the fittinge of
all thinges belonginge to a feight. A shipp that is
full of Munition small and greate and her feightes
and ordinances well disposed and placed is called
a shipp well armed To arme a shott is to bynd
some Ockhand or Rope, yarne, or ould cloutes &c.
a bout one end as in crosebarr shott it is most
commonly vsed, That that end which goes fast out
of the peece should nott catch hold in anie flawes 
of the Peece whereby it be in danger to breake it
The same wee vse to anie Peece of broken iron
of one or two foote longewhich we vse when we come
bord & bord, in feight and of our greate Ordinance
wee vse alsoe to arme some smale shott for 
musketes like our Crosebarre.




an Awninge
Is a saile or  anie other thinge made of Canvas
or the like which is spread over anie parte or all of the
shipp a bove the deckes to keepe a waye the Sunne
That thereby in hott Countryes men maye take
the ayre and yet not be soe subject to the beames
of the Sunne: In all hott voyages, This is of infinite
vse both to keepe men from the Sunne by daye, and
the dewes by night, which in some places are 
wonderfull infectious:/

 
 



Axeltrees 
The Axeltree is the same in a Carriage as in
a Coach or Carter And doth support the Cheekes
of the Carriage whereon the Peece doth lye 
Alsoe we call the Iron which goes through the 
Wheele of the Chayne Pumpe & beares the
Waight of it: The Axeltree of the Pumpe;/




B

Bale
Is to lade  water out of the shipp holde 
wth Buckettes Cannes or the like, This because
it is more labourious & tyres men sooner and doth
not deliver soe much as all the Pumpes will
wee never vse but in great extremetie when 
either a leake doth over growe the deliueringe of the 
Pumpes or else that the Pumpes doe faile vs - 
wch happens manie tymes in extraordinarie longe
Pumpinge: That the Pumpe with over much
weareinge draw winde or Chance to be Stoaked
or else the Pumpe Boxes Irons or the like doe
faile vs:/




Ballast
Is that Gravell Stones lead or anie other goodes
wch is layd next to the keelson of the shipp to
keepe her fast in the Sea; Of Ballast That is



best which is heaviest, lyes Closest and fastest and 
is drest both for the shipps bearinge a saile 
stowinge of goodes, The health of the Companie 
and saveinge of Caskes or other goodes whereof
if a shipp have too much shee will drawe too much
water; If too little she will beare not sayle To
trench the Ballast that is to divide the Ballast
in anie parte of the shipps holde, which is Comonly done
to finde a leake in the bottome of the shippe or to 
vnstocke the shipp: The Ballast Shootes, That is
runnes over from one side to an other, and 
therefore Corne and all kinde of gaine is dangerous
loadinge for that will shoote, but only that they make
Poutches as they are called, that is Bulkheades 
of boardes to keepe it vpp fast, that it doe not
runne from one side to another as the shipp 
doth heele vpon a Taske:/ 




a Baye
Is when twoo Loyntes or Head Lands
lie soe farr of in to the Sea, that drawing
a straight lyne from the one to the other
there ys made towardes the Maine-Lande
a hollownesse or part of a Circle which is filled
with water, bee yt more or lesse, that same
is called a Baye vnlesse there be anie pasÂ­
sage Navigable thorowe for then it beares
the name of a Straight and not of a Baye
But comonlie wee doe not giue it the name
of a Baie vnlesse there be some emynent
depth and Indraught as tis vsuallie tearmed
And yt matters not whether the distance beÂ­
twixt the pointes bee little or much) for the
Baie of Biscaie, the Baie of Portingale,
the Baie of Mexico and divers others are

the Beake or 
Beakehead
Is that parte which is fastened to the Stemme of the
shipp and is supported with a knee which is fastened
into the Stemm and  this is called the mayne
knee To this is fastened the coller of the 
mayne staye: In the Beakehead the foretackes
are brought to bord, And is the proper stand
where men doe handle most partes of the sprit sayle 
and Sprit sayle top saile Rigginge, And it is 
alsoe placed for the fashion and grace of the shipp
The Beakeshead Steeves or standes, Steeveing,
That is standes very much with the outwardmost end 
vp towardes to Boate spritt The Beakeheades of the
Venetian Argores & Spanish Gallions doe soe
very much - by which we knowe them afarr off./






Beame
The Beames are those greate Crosse tymbers 
wch keepe the shipps sides asunder & doe support
the Deckes or loopes: accordinge to whose strength
a shipp is much the better or worse, able to carry 
Ordinance: All stronge and greate shipps have
a Tyre of Beames in hould,, that is a Rowe of 
Beames wherein lies noe decke The Maine 
Beame is ever the next to the Maine mast, at wch
place wee recon the bredth of the shipp. And
from this wee call the Beames, which forward &
aftward by the name of first second, third &c. 
begininge from this wee call the Mydshipp 
Beame:/




to Beare
This word in some cases is taken in the 
ordinarie sense and as for carryinge much, As 
when we saye a shipp will beare much Ordinance,
that is carry much by reason of her strength: Alsoe
the beareinge or Stowinge of much goodes, from 
whence when we describe the greatenes of a shipp
we saye she is a shipp of such a burthen But
is is vsed in many senses different accordinge
to the diversitie of the Phrases: to Beare saile
that is as much to saye she is a stiffe sided shipp 
and will not lower downe of a side with a greate 
deale of saile: a A shipp to beare out her ordinance
That is ment her Ordinance lie soe high, and she 
will goe soe vpright that in reasonable feightinge 
wether she wilbe able to keepe out her lower tyre
and not be forct to shutt in her Porte One 
shipp overbere the others That is was able in 
a greate Gale of winde to carry out more saile
then the other vizt A Toppsaile more or the
like To beare vnder the Lee of A shipp is 



when that shipp is to weather comes vnder the other 
 shipps Sterne and soe gives the winde to
her that is the greatest Curtesie that a shipp 
cann give an other att Sea:, The Peece will 
Beare more shott or not soe much The Peece will 
Beare more , That is she is
overcharged or else will endure a greater charge
The Peece doth come to beare: A terme in the 
vse of Ordinance by which is ment that now shee
lyes right with the marke:/




Beare in
when a shipp sailes before or with a large winde
into a harbor or Channell or else sailes large 
towardes the land we saie she beares in with the
Channell Harbor or land: But if she saile 
Close by a winde we vse not that speech:/




 Beare off
when a shipp would not come neere a land or
an other shipp but goe more roomyer then her 
Course doth lye we saye that she beares off
from the land Alsoe when wee tell how our headÂ­
land Iland shipp or the like doth lye from an 
other (That is vpon what poynt of Compasse) 
wee saye they beare right East or west or otherwise
off one an other: In hoysinge anie thinge into the 
shipp If it catch hold  by anie parte
of the shipp or Ordinance or the like, They saye
Beare it off from the shipps sides, soe if they 
would have the Breech or mouth of a Peece of
Ordinance or the like, putt forwares on, They
saye Board off or beare about the Peece, Soe
that generally Seamen vse this word beare off


 
in business belonginge to shippinge in steed
of the word Thrust off which to the like sense is
most Commonly vsed a mongst others:/




Beare vp
This is a word we vse in the Condinge the
shipp when as wee would have her goe larger or
more before the winde then she did Beare vp 
Round That is to saue to putt her right afore
the winde, or to bringe her before the Lee The
manner of doeinge it is noe more but thrustinge
the Helme vp to windward as farr as it will 
goe towardes the shipps side:



 
Bedds
When the deckes lye to lowe from the Portes
soe that the Carriages of the Peeces with the
Trunkes Cannot mount the Ordinance fittingly
butt that they will lye too neere the Portlase
or Gunwall Then we make a false decke 
for soe much as the Peece will require for her
Traversinge to raise it higher, This we call
a bedd Alsoe in the Carriage of the Peece
That Plancke which lyes lowermost next the
Carriage vnder the Breeck of the Peece 
Whereon the loynes do lye is called the Bedd. 




to Belay
Is to make fast anie runninge Rope when it
is halde as much as you would As the 
Hallyiards when you hoise a yard or the sheates
or Tackes & soe that it cannot Runn forth 
againe till it be loosed:/






A Bend
Is the outwardmost tymber on the shipps side and
is alsoe called a wale These are the Cheife 
strength of the shipps sides to which the Fluttockes
and knees of the Teames are boulted and they
are called by the name of first Second &c. beginning
wth that next the water:/




to Bend or Bent
Is taken in the Common sense as when the 
Shancke of the Anchor is with overmuch swayinge
crooked wee saye it is bent But it is otherwise
vsed As when they saye is the Cabell bent 
That is when it is seized and made fast to
the ringe of the Anchor Vnbend the 
Cabell That is vnbende it which we are Commonly 
when wee make accompt to be longe at sea before
wee come into Harbor To bend two Cabells 
or Ropes together, that is to tye them together
wth a knott and soe make their owne endes fast 
vpon them selves: This is not soe sure as spliceing
two Ropes together but it is sooner done and 
most Comonly vsed when wee meane to take 
them asunder againe as when a warpe or anie 
rope is too short for the present vse:/




a Berth
Is a Conveinent distance & Roome to Moore 
a shipp in Alsoe when they would goe cleere off
a Poynt or a Rocke, They saye take a good Berth
That is goe a pretty distance of to seabord of it 




Bearthing
They call the raysinge or bringinge vpp of 
a shipps side the Bearthinge of her As they
saye a Clincher hath her sides Bearthed vpp
before anie Beames be putt into her;/





a Bight
By a Bight is meant anie parte of a Rope as it is
taken Compasinge. As when we cannot or meane 
not to take the ende in hande, (be it of a Cabell or 
other smalle Rope beinge Quoyled vpp) we saye
give mee the Bight or hold by the Bight That is by
one of the fakes which lyes roled vpp one over an 
other:/




Bildge or
Buldg
The Bildge of the shipp is the bredth of the floore
whereon the shipp doth rest when she is aground
A shipp is Bilged, That is when she stickes on
a Rocke, or an Anchor or the like and breakes
anie of her tymbers or Planckes there and
soe springes a leake:/




Bildge-water
Is the water which by reason of the shipps 
breadth & depth lies in the Bildg and cannott 
come to the walle And therefore the Flemish
shipps which have generally broader & lower 
floores then our shipps have besides the ordinarie 
Pumps at the Mayne Mast two Bildg Pumps/ and
these Pumpes are Commo placed forwards
on by the Bitts: When the Shipp is trymmed
most a Head, then Shee houldes most Bildg.


From "and these Pumpes are" to the end are absent from British Library Sloane MS 207 
but found in British Library Additional MS 21571, fol. 19v.




theBittakell
Is a Close Cubbord placed in the Steeridg 
before the Whipp or Tyller whereon the Com&
passe doth stande which is not fastende together
wth Iron nayles, butt woodden pinnes because
the Iron would drawe the Compasse soe that
it would never stande true These are soe to
be Contrived That they maye carry a Canddell
or light in them to give light to the Compasse 
soe as they disperse not anie light nor gett to 
lett anie bee seene about the shipp:/





a Bitter
Is noe more but a turne of the Cabell about the
Bittes which is vsed in this kinde: when we come to
Anchor in anie greate tyde or Current, or
winde especially in deepe water after the Cabell
is runn out a Convenient waye we take aturne
wch is about the bittes that wee may by little & little
veere it out att ease for otherwise if a stopper should
chance to faile, the Cabell would runn all out or
(as the Phrase is) End for End, Now the turne of
the Cabell is called a Bitter And when the shipp
is by this meanes stopped, we saye the shipp is 
brought vpp to a Bitter:/




Bitter end
Is that end of the Cabell which is vsed to be wthin
borde still att the Shipp, when the shipp rides at an
Anchor: Soe that vpon occation when they would 
have that end bent to the Anchor they say bend
to the Bitter end:/



 
the Bitts
are the two mayne square peeces of tymber
wch stand piller wise and are Comonly placed 
abast the manger in the loose of the ship and 
for noe other vse but to make fast and as it were
to belage the Cabell vnto, when wee ride att an 
Anchor The lower parte of them is fastened in hold to
the riders, but the middle parte doth beare for their
better strength And are bolted in greate shipps
to two beames which Crosse to the Bowes of the shipp
And therefore in sometymes in extraordinary
stormes wee are fayne to make fast the Cabell
to the Mayne Mast for the better releiveinge 
the Bittes and safetie of the Bowes which have
in great Roadsteds are violently torne from 
the after parte of the shipp:/





Breech 
Breechinge
The Breech is the aftermost parthe of the
Gunne from the Touchhole which is in Brasse 
Ordinance ever allowed to be as thicke as the
Diameter of Bullett And those Ropes which are
bigger then the tackles that doe make or lace
fast the Ordinance to the shipps sides beinge
brought aboute the Breech of the Peece are
called Breechinge, These wee doe not vse in
feight but at Sea and cheifely in foule weather:/




a Breice
Is a wynde which blowes out of the Sea and doth
daylie in seasonable faire weather keepe his 
Course begininge lightly about ix in the morninge
and lastinge till  it be wthin little of night
wee doe not Commonly call all wyndes that blowe off
the Sea vpon anie Coaste Breeses vnles it be 
there where this Course is certaine, or rarely
mysses, but in Stormes and foule weather: As
fore examples here on our Coast the wyndes are 
neuer certayne But on the Coast of Barbary and
other places more Southerly they are certayne
to have the wynd of the land all night and of


 
the Sea all daye This Breeice is alsoe called
a Sea turne,/




A Brestfast
Is a Rope which is fastened to some parte of the shipp
forward on and soe doth holde fast the shipps head
to a wharfe or anie thinge else and a Stern Fast
is the same for a Sterne,/




Broominge 
Is when a shipp is brought aground or on 
the Carreens to be trymmed That is to bee
made Cleane. They bringe off the old weedes
or Stuffe which hath gathered filth which they 
vsually doe either with reedes, Broome old Ropes
or the like:/




a Budg Barrell
Is a little Barrell not altogeather soe bigge
as a barrell which hath an hundred weight of 
powder, and hath a purse of leather made 
att the head of it: which is to shutt over the Powder
to keepe it from fyreinge: we vse to laye Ordinance
wth this in the Harbor for healths and the like, but
att Sea in feight not if we can gett Carthrages ithout
wch this is the safest waye There are alsoe 
Latin Budg barrells which are the best:/




Bulke
The Bulke of a shipp is her whole Content
in holde, as to saye she is a shipp of a greate
Bulke that is will stow much goodes Sometymes



it is taken for the Marchantes goodes As when
they saye lett our stocke goe in Bulke together
To Breake Bulke is as muchas to saye to
open the holde and sell or parte the goodes in 
hold: As the Indie shipps maye sell anie 
goodes which they have betwixt the deckes. But
they must not breake Bulke till they have order
from the Companie, That is they must not
open the Holde to medle with anie MarchanÂ­
dize therein Conteyned:/




Bulk-head
Is generally anie division which is made Crosse
the shipp with bordes whereby one Roome is
divided from an other. As the Bulkhead 
of the Cabin. The Bulkhead of the decke 
The Bulkhead of the Breadroome Gunnroome
or the like:/ 




Bunt
The Bunt of asaile is as it were in CompaÂ­
rison of the wind, the Codd of the Nett which 
receives all the fishe, and may aswell be 
called the very bagg of the saile, and therefore
wee give a Bunt to all sailes to the intent
they may receive much winde which is the 
Anima sensitua of a shipp: If a shipp have
to much Bunt it will hange to much to LeeÂ­
ward and as they call it hold much Leeward
winde which will hinder the shipps saileinge
especially by the winde If it have to little either
it will not hold winde enough and soe not give
the shipp sufficient waye: The difference is
rather perceived in topp sailes then the other 
for Courses are Cutt square or at least wth
allowance of small Compasse:/




Bunt Lynes
Is a smale lyne which is made fast to the bottome


 
of the saile in the midle parte of the Boltrope to
a Creengle and soe reeved through asmale 
blocke seised to the yard. The vse whereof is to
Tryse vpp the Bunt of the saile for the better
farthellinge and makeinge vpp of the sailes 




A Bouy
Is that peece of wood Barrell or the like wch
floates right over the Anchor and is made 
fast by the Buoy rope vnto the Flooke The 
vse whereof is not only to take knowledge where
the Anchor is: But alsoe to weight the Anchor
wth the Boate which is sooner done then to weigh
it with the shipp Streame the Buoy That
is before they lett the Anchor fall whilst the 
shipp hath waye They putt the Buoy into the
water soe that the Buoy Rope may be stretched
out straight and then the Anchor will fall Cleere
from entanglinge it selfe in the Buoy Rope
Buoyant Is anie thinge that is floateing or apt
to floate To Buoy vpp a Cabell, That is to
make fast anie peece of floatinge wood Barrell
or the like to the Cabell somewhat neere to 
the Anchor That the Cabell may not touch
the ground This wee vse in foule groundes where
wee feare the Cuttinge of our Cabells. There
are Buoyes alsoe which doe not belonge to shipps
And those are left att an Anchor in the Sea
to showe where anie danger is of sandes or 
Rockes These are specially most needefull 
to be vsed where the sandes doe vse to alter or
where wee can have noe fittinge landmarke;/




A Butt
By this word taken indifferently is meant
avessell or Caske, as a Butt of wine &c. But



in sea language thus A Butt is properly
the end of a Plancke ioyninge to an other of 
the outward side of a shipp vnderwater To 
springe a Butt that is when a Plancke is 
loose att one end and therefore the Boult in
most great shipps, all the Buttheades, By 
buttheades is ment the endes of the Plancke;/




the Buttock:/
The Buttocke of a shipp is the Breadth of
the shipp right asterne from the Tack vpwardes
and therefore acordinge as she is buylt broad
or narrowe att the Transome or layinge out
of the Sterne we say the shipp hath a broad
or Narrow Buttock:/






C

a Cabell
Is a three strand Rope intended to be sufficient for
a shipp to Ride by att an Anchor for otherwise it is 
Counted but a hawser: For a greate shipps hawser
will make a little shipps Cabell Cabells have severall
appellacions as the Anchore And are called the 
First Second or third as they growe in greatnesse
begininge with the least till it come to Sheate Anchor
Cabell: the best Cabells are those which are made
Of the whitest stuffe: and therefore Straights
Cabells are the best: The next the Flemmish and
Russia; the last ours The makeinge of a Cabell is 
termed the layinge, as to saye this Cabell was 
well laid: Serue the Cabell or Plate the Cabell
is to binde some olde ropes Cloutes or the like to save
it from gawlinge in the house Splice a Cabell is
to fasten two Cabells togeather with a Splice: Coile
a Cabell is to laye it vpp in Rowles one a bove an
other Cable tire is the Cabell soe layd vp in Roules
Pay more Cabell That is when they Carry out 
an Anchor and Cabell in the Boate to turne
over into the sea some Cabell that the Boate
may Rowe the Easier and the Cabell be slacke
in the water: Pay Cheap. That is fling it over 
the water a pace Veere more Cabell, That is
lett more goe out Shott of Cabell vide shott:/




Caburnes
Is a smale lyne made of spunn yarne, to bindd 
the Cabells or to make a Bend of two Cabells
or to sease the wyndinge tackles or the like;/




a Calme &
Becalme
Is when at sea wee have not anie wynde: And
then wee add to it these Epithitons: flatt dead 
or Starke Calme: A Calme is more troublesome
to a Seafareinge man then a storme if he have
a stronge shipp and Searoome enough In some



places (as in the Straightes) when it is extraordinary
greate storm with much windes and a wroughte
sea on the suddaine there wilbe noe winde but
a flatt Calme yett an extraordinarie billowe, wch
is wondrous troublesome and dangerous, for then
haveinge noe vse for sayle to helpe her stedy 
on aside, the greate sea will make a shipp roule
soe that unlesse she be a very fast shipp in the 
water she wilbe in danger to rowle her Maste by
the board or her selfe vnder water Becalminge is
when anie thinge takes a way the winde from 
another As when one shipp is vnder the Lee of an 
other, The Windermoste shipp doth becalme the 
Leeward Mast; Alsoe when wee are neere the 
land which keepes the winde from vs, we saye 
it doth becalme vs:/




Camber or 
Camberinge
We saye a decke lyes Camberinge when it is
higher in the middle then att either end and soe
doth not lye vpon aright line This word is most
Commonly applied to the shipps Keele Beames 
and other Roundinge Peeces in the shipps frame
Camber keeled, is when the Keele is bent in the 
middle vpwardes which happens many tymes by 
a shipp vneven lyinge vpon the ground when 
either her aftermost par,te or foremost doth not
touch: But the most Common cause and cheife
reason of Camberinge in great and longe shipps
is the sharpnesse of the hull afore & abast, and
the fullnesse of the floore a myde shipps which 
haveinge noe breadth to beare vpon the water
is harder to sinke then both endes before & abast 
wch by reason of the sharpenesse, and greate
weight over head, ther Rakes which over hanges
the grounds worke, sinkes faster into the water,
and soe their weight forces the Keele & whole
worke in the Mydshipps to weigh vpwardes wch
is the mayne reason of the shipps Camberinge;/






the Cap:
Is the square peece of tymber which is putt over the
head of anie Mast, with a Round hole for to receive
into it the Topmast, or flagstaffe by which the
Toppmast is kept steddie: For is the head of 
the Mayne Mat be too shorte soe that the Capp
stand to neere the heele or bottome of the TopÂ­
Mast: The Topmast will neuer steddie 
and beside the weight of the Topmast will strayne
the head of the Mayne Mast soe much that
it wilbe in Danger to spend it, or beare it by the
bord Euery Mast hath a Capp, if it Carry anÂ­
other, or but a Flagstaffe at the topp;/




Cap-squares
Are the broad peeces of Iron which belonge to 
either side of the Carriages of a peece of 
Ordinance to locke over the truniyons of the 
Peece over which they are made fast in an 
Iron Pinne with afore lock The vse whereof is 
to keepe the Peece from flyinge out of the
Carryadge when it is shott off the Mouth of it
lyinge very Lowe or as the Phrase is vnder Mettle;/




theCapstaine
There are two kindes of Capstaines: The one
called the Capstayne or the Mayne Capstayne
and is that peece of tymber which is over placed
right vpp and downe abast the Mayne Mast
the Foote standinge in a Stepe in the Lower
decke and the head beinge betwixt the two 
vpper deckes; the partes are these: The foote 
the Spindell, the whellpes, the Barrell & the 
Holes For the Barres To which alsoe belonge
the Paule of Iron The vse of it is Cheifely 
to weigh our Anchore and generally to hoise
or strike downe topmast or to heave in anie
thinge of weight As ordinance and the 



or indeede to strayne anie Rope that requires
greate force The second is a Geere Capstaine
wch is placed in the same manner betwixt the
Mayne and foremastes. The vse whereof is 
cheifely to heave vpp the Geere Rope or else
to hold off by when wee heave the Anchor Att
the foote of this there are whelpes placed in alesser
proporcion which is to heave vpon the violl for 
the help of the Maine Captaine in weighinge 
a greate Anchor. Com vp the Capstaine That
is these which are at the Cappstaine must goe
backwardes and slacken the Rope or Cabell wch
they did heave not. In the same sense they alsoe
vse these wordes Launch at the Captaine; That
is to stopp it with the Iron Paule which bearinge
against the whellpes keepe the Capstaine 
from turninge back :/


The catchword on the previous page reads "like".




Capstaine
Barrs
Are smale peeces of tymber putt through 
the barrell of the Capstaine through square
holes of Equall length of both sides by which men doe
heave and turne a boute the Capstaine:




Carde or
Sea Carde
Is a Geographicall descripcion of Coastes with 
the true distance heightes and Courses or 
wyndes layd downe in it not describinge anie
Inland which belonges to Mapps The differences
and vses of them will require a longe discourse,
and they are sett downe in most bookes wch
write of Navigacion and therefore I leave
them to those bookes:/




Careene
Careeninge is the best waye of trymminge 



a shipp vnderwater Both for that the Carpenter
maye stand vpon the Sea Foldes most comodiouslie
to Caulke the Seames, or doe anie thinge that shalbe
requisit Alsoe for saveinge the ground tymbers
wch especially in shipps of greate Burthen and 
weight must needes be much wronged though they 
be layne neuer soe stronge Besides it is amost 
necessarie trymminge for greate shipps wch
are either olde or weake built: And alsoe for anie
shipps which have but smale flore, and are built soe
sharpe vnderwater that they wilbe in danger of
overthrowinge when they shalbe brought aground
This Careeninge is to be done in harbor, where
the slower the tyde runes the better, and it is
most Commonly vsed in such places where there are
noe deckes to tryme ashipp in Nor noe good places
to grave a shipp on, or else that it doth not ebb soe
much that a shipp may sewe drye: For the manner
of Careeninge it wilbe to longe and vnnecessarie 
to sett downe att the perticulers: In generall
it is this: They take out all or heave but little
of the Prouision Ballast, Ordinance or the like
in the shipp: And you must have alower shipp
by her, with which she must be haled downe on aside
and righted againe with tackles yet with the weight
of Ballast a bove or belowe they doe effect the
Cheife force of the busines and soe neuer straine
the shipps Maste much Note that all shipps are
not of a like Condicion to Careene for some shipps
wilbe very hard to come downe though they have 
noe ballast in: And those are Stemminges, built
wth two standinge streakes These must have 
some weight vpon the streake to help them downe
And yet these will right them selves very Easily
and therefore neede not much in holde to helpe to
right them: Some (as our English built & the like)



will come downe easie and be hard to right -
And therefore wee keepe somewhat in all 
these to right them in holde & haveinge noethinge
on the deckes some will come downe easilie and
right them selves well. Some will doe neither, soe
that there is not one waye for all, but as we see 
the Condicion of the shipp wee fitt thinges and 
worke accordingly: And kindes of bringinge
the shipp over to lye on one side she beinge on
floate is called Careeninge though it be but 
a fewe streakes If a shipp lye downe much 
wth a saile They saye she sailes on the Careene/




Carlings
Are those tymbers which lye alonge the shipp 
from one beame to another which doe not only
serve to help, and strenghen the shipp, but on
them the Ledges doe rest wherevnto the Plancks
of the decke are fastened./




Carlinge
knees
Are those tymbers which come Thwart shipps
from the shipps sides to the Hatch waye which is
betwixt the two Mastes These doe beare vpon 
them the decke on both sides the Mast, and on their
endes doe lye the Coamings of the Hatches;/




a Carriage /
Is that whereon we mount our Ordinance
The artes whereof are the two Cheekes The
Axeltrees the Boltes, the Capsquares The
hookes, the fore lockes, the Trunckes, and the 
Lyne pinnes, vide every one of these in his proper
place: the fashion of these Carriages we 
vse at Sea, are much better, then those of the 
land yet the Venetions and divers others vse 
the other in their shippinge A Peece carryes
a shott well That is shee shootes farre & Right wch



is a signe that she is smooth and well mettled;/




a Cartridg:
Is a bagg made of Canuas which is reasonable good
beinge made vpon a former, The diameter 
whereof must be somewhat smaler then the Sillender
of the Peece and of such a length and depth as that
it shall conteyne iust soe much powder as is the
Charge of the Peece: This is wonderous necessarie
for our greate Orindance in feight both for the
speedie ladeinge our Ordinances and alsoe for 
saveinge the Pouder: which is in danger to be 
fyred, if in feight we should vse aladle: These 
Cartidgs are manie tymes made of paper
parchment or the like but are not soe good 
as the other There are alsoe other Cartidgs
or more properly they are to be called Cases 
for Cartidges which are made of Latine in wch
wee vse to putt These other Cartriges to bringe
a longst the shipp soe much the safer from 
the fyre till wee putt them into the Peeces
mouth, which is acare that in a fieght there 
cannot be to much diligence & order vsed,/




Caruells
Are vessells which goe with Missen sailes in steed
of Maine sailes: These will lye neere the
winde then Crosse sayles, but are not soe commoÂ­
dious to handle: we have herelittle vse of them
and therefore I speke not much;/




Caruell workes
the Buildinge of shipps first with their - 
Tymbers and beames and after bringinge on
theire Planckes is called Caruell worke to 
distinguish it from Clynch worke;/






a Case 
Is Commonly made round of wood, hollowed & fitt
for the bore of the Peece: By which most conveniently
we can putt murderinge Shott in to the Peece:
wee likewise vse bagges to the same purpose /
but they are apter to Catch hold by the 
waye in the flawes of the peeces: Alsoe some
call the Sheathinge of a shipp the Caseinge
of her




a Case shott
Is anie kinde of old Iron stones Muskett
Bullets or the like which we putt into Cases to
shoote out of our greate Ordinance These
are of greate vse and doe much execucion 
amongst men that ply their smale shott 
when we come neere or lye Bord & Bord;/




Casketts
Are smale stringes made of Sinnett flatt
They are made fast to the vpper end of the
yardes in little Ringes which they call Grommetts
Their vse is to make fast the saile to the yard
when wee farthell it vpp The biggest & longest
are placed iust in the middle of the yardes 
betwixt the Tyes These doe make vp the Bunt
of the saile and are termed the Brest casketts:/




Catherpings
Are a smalle Rope which runnes in little blockes
like a Minum from one side of the shroudes to
the other neere the vpper decke; The vse where
of is to force the shroudes taughter for the better
ease and safetie of the Mast in the Rowlinge
of the shipp They are only vsed to the Maine
shroudes & fore shroudes: Alsoe att the settinge on
of the Buttockes of the shroudes they are vsed
But heare they are neuer made fast & doe not
Runne in Blocks;/






Catt
The Catt is a peece of tymber fastened aloft
right over the Hawse and hath att the end thereof
Two Sheevers wherein is Reeved a Rope wth
a Blocke wherevnto is fastened a greate hooke
of Iron after the manner of a double tackle:
The vse is to Trice vp the Anchor from the
hawse to the tope of the fore Castle where it 
is fastened with astopper: Catt the Anchor is
to Hitch the hooke in the ringe of the Anchor




Catt holes
Are two little holes a bove the Gunnroome
Ports a sterne for that this vse That when 
wee have occasion to heave the shipp a sterne
by a Sterne fast, They bringe in the Cabell or
hawser by them to the Capstaine. The sterne
Ports are not soe good because they lye not soe
Even with the Capstaine;/




Caulke
Caulkinge is the dryveinge of Ockham SpunnÂ­
haire and the like into all seames, Rents and
treenailes throughout the shipp wthout the 
wch it is impossible for a shipp to be made tight
to Swyme and keepe out water;/




Chase
When a man of Warre doth followe anie shipp
out of his Course or else when anie other 
shipp doth alter her Course, soe as to vse all
the meanes they cann to fetch vpp and speke
wth an other shipp wee call that Chaseinge
and the shipp soe followed we call the Chase
As (meaning by her) we saye The Chase 
standes thus, or the Chase hath taken in her TopÂ­
sailes or the Chase is strooke or Hull & There 



is greate experience and Iudgment to be vsed
in Chaseinge For if Two men be equall 
Marriners and knowe how to saile and direct
his shipp yet if one be a Practique man of
warr and the other not, The man of warr
will doe much better The pretense in any
Chaseinge is to make the shortest waye of it
that they cann: which is by iudginge the Chases
Course and soe to shape yours that you may 
meete in the nearest Angles there is noe 
certayne rule for Chaseinge for wee must
many tymes be ruled by the Condicion of our
shipp: As if the Chase clap close by, a wynd
it beinge a head Sea And the Man of Warre
shipp be a short shipp that beates off to the Sea 
and a Leeward shipp Then if he clap close by
awynd his shipp will make noe waye And
therefore he must goe alittle more large 
Though he Chase vnder the Lee of the other
In Chaseinge well alwayes covett to gett 
a wyndward in resspect that it is advantage
in feight and for that we cannot Bord a shipp
to Leeward, but som tymes (as if it be) towardes 
night to keepe sight of a shipp or the like we
must be content to come vnder his Lee and 
gett as neere as wee cann: The Sterne Chase
That is when wee followe her right asterne
and she & wee goe right vpon one poynt of
the Compasse To lye with her fore foole is the
neerest and shortest That is as y ou would say
to lye iust a Crosse her waye soe that both 
keepinge on their Courses they shall meete
att a certayne poynt: Chase peeces are those
wch lye right forward or right Aftward on: when
wee saye a shipp hath a good Chase in differently 
it is ment of her Chase forward, And that is
when she is soe contrived that she can carry



many peeces to shoote right forward for to the other
they ever vse to add the word Sternechase, The
Peeces of Ordinance which lye right foreward on are 
called Chase peeces;/




Chafe
Or Chafinge is when anie Rope is galled or 
fretted As wee saye The Cabell is Chafed in the
Hawse or when a Rope rubbs against anie thinge
wch is not smooth and even, wee saye, it will Chafe
the Rope:/




Chaines
By nameinge the Chaynes of a shipp indifferently
is ment those Chaynes by which the shroudes are 
made fast on the shipps sides: Alsoe those that 
belonge to the toppmast shroudes are called 
Chaines: In feight wee vse to slinge our yardes in 
, Chaynes for feare least the Bill should bee
Cutt, and soe the yard pull downe: And these
Chaynes are called Slynges:/




Chaine wale
Is a broader tymber sett on the out side of 
the shipp then the ordinary walls and is made
soe of purpose to spread out the shroudes wyder
that they may the better succour the Mast;/




Chamber
Is a Charge mayde of Brasse or Iron which wee
vsed to putt in att the breech of anie Murderer
or fowlie and conteynes iust soe much powder 
as is fitt to deliuer a waye the Murderinge or 
Case shott conteyned in that Peece Alsoe the
Chamber of a greate peece of whole Ordinance
is Counted soe farre, or soe much of it as 
doth Conteyne the whole Charge it hath;/





Channell
By Channell is ment the deepest parte of anie
Riuer in harbores mouth: As when we saye Steere
in the Channell, is ment the deepest parte of the
ryuer, In paces where there are loose Sandes
The Channells doe alter much accordinge to 
the extraordinarie wyndes which come and drive
the sandes with the sea somtymes on one syde and
somtymes on an other: As when I came into 
Mammora the Channell laye in East South East,
and West North west which is Fiue poyntes of the 
Compasse. Some tymes we call narrow Seas
Channells: as the English Channell betwixt
France and England And St. Georges 
Channell betwixt England and Ireland But 
beinge in those Seas If wee saye Steere into 
the Channell it is ment into the mides of the 
Sea: /




Charge
We use to saye Charge a Muskett, but load or
Lade a Peece of Ordinance A shipp of great
Charge is Commonly ment by a shipp that drawes
much water: And sometymes for an vnwieldy
shipp that will not Veere and Steere for then 
shee is dangerous and Chargeable upon a shore
alsoe every mans office in a shipp is Called 
his Charge: /




Cheekes
Are two peeces of Tymber, which are fitted
on each side of the Mast from beneath the honndes
to the upper end of the mast and they are 
made of Oake to Strengthen the Mast there
aboutes both for the beareinge of the Topmast
and hoisinge the yarde. In these are the honndes
made for the tyes to runne in The Knees wch
fasten the Beakehead to the Bowe of the



Shipp are called Cheekes alsoe the side of anie 
blockes are Called the Cheekes likewise the side
of the Carriages whereon the Trunnyons of the 
peece doe lye are called the Cheekes of the
Carriages:/




Chestrees
Are the two smale peeces of tymber wth
wholes in them in which the Mayne tacke doth 
Runne and to which the Tacke is halled downe: These
are placed a little abast the loofe of the shipp
the one on the side, The other on the other:/




Choake 
when a Runninge Rope stickes in a Blocke either
by flypinge betwixt the Cheeks & the Sheever 
or by anie other occasion, that anie thinge be 
gott about it; Or that I have a kynke soe that 
it cannott runne, and be halde through it we
saye the Blocke is Choaked:/




Clamps
Are those tycke tymbers, which lye fore & Aft
Close under the Beames of the first Orlap &
doe beare them up at either End And are the
same that the Risinges are att the other end 
vide Risings:/




a Cleate
Is a smale wedge of wood fastened on the yardes
to keepe anie Roapes from the stopinge by where 
that is fastened, There are alsoe diuers other
uses of it. As to keepe the Earinge of the 
sayle from slypinge of the yard:/




Clewe
The Clewe of a saile is the lower Corner
of a saile which reaches downe to the place 



where the Tackes and Sheates are made fast
to the saile And it is Counted that parte wch
comes Goareinge out from the square of the
sayle towarde the lower Corners: when 
a Saile is much goareinge then she hath
a greate Clewe: when a little goareinge 
then she hath a little Clewe: when it cutt right square
then it hath noe Clewe: And yet that lower
Corner of the sayle shall retayne the lower
Clewe of the sayle. A ship A ship spreades a greate
Clewe, That is hath very broad yeardes, and soe
spreades much Canvas It is good to allowe 
a good Clewe to a Mayne saile for by that meanes
the Tacke will come the better a boarde and the
Sheate will come farther Aft where by the 
saile will hold more wynde:/




Clewe Garnett
Is a Rope which is made fast to the Clewe of the
sail, and from thence runnes in a Blacke
wch is seased to the Middle of the yard The
vse whereof is when wee farthell a Maynesaile
or foresaile (for the name of Clewe Garnett
doth only belonge to the Clewe lynes of those 
Two sayles) Then this Rope doth hale vpp the
Clewe of the saile Close to the Middle parte
of the yarde:/




Clewe lines
This is the same to Topsayles, Topgallant
sayles and spritt sailes That the Clewe
Garnett is to the Mayne saile and hath the
very same vse: Note in fowle weather & Gust
when wee take in our Topsailes wee hale home
the Clewes lyne first, because the sayle wilbe
taken soe much the Easier:/




A Clinch
Is to batter or Ryvitt a boltes end vpon a Ringe
Or turne backe the end of anie nayle soe as it 



make it fast att the end which is driven through wee 
alsoe call that parte of the Cabell which is seized about
the Ringe of the Anchor the Clinch of the Cabell/




a Clyncher:/
Is a smale shipp: Barke or Boate, whose planckes
or Boardes are larded over one an other and 
Clinched or nayled one through an other wth nayles and Reeves whose outesides
are Birthed or wrought upp wthout Tymbers 
framed as wee doe in other shipps which worke is
called Carvell worke:/




Clinching. 
Is as you would saye a slight Caulkinge And is
most used when wee are att Sea & suspect fowle
weather, soe that we may take in water at the
Portes wee use to Commannde the Carpenter
To Clinch the Portes: That is to drive alittle
Ockham into the Seames of the Portes wch
May be done to serve forme either wthin 
Board or wthout Bord:/




Cloath
Wee saye a saile doth Cloathe the Mast
when it is soe longe that it touches the gratinges
or Hatches: soe as that noe winde cann goe 
betwixt the sailes and the hatches or gratinges
A shipp spreades much Cloath that is when
she hath much Broad sailes:/




Cloyde
When thereis anie thinge gott into the touch
hole or Breech of the peece soe that the pryminge
powder cannot come to give fire to the rest
wee saye the Peece is Cloyed;/






Coakes,
Are little square thinges of brasse with a hole
in them putt in the middle of some of the greatest
woodden sheevers to keepe them from splytinge
and gallinge by the Pinn of the Clocke whereÂ­
on they turne;/




Coamings
The Coaminges or Coaming of the Hutches
or the gratinges, is that peece of tymber or
Plancke which beares them vpp higher then the
deckes, soe as they doe not lye even with the Decke
The vses whereof are to keepe the water from
runninge downe at the Hutches to give some
ease for men to stand vpright betwixt the 
lower deckes, If the deckes belowe and
neere togeather And alsoe in the Coaminges
they may fitt holes to vse Muskettes and soe 
serve for a Close feight;/




Coats
Those peeces of Tarrd Canvas which are putt
About the Mastes of the Partures & the Pumps
att the decke that noe water runne downe 
by them are called Coates The same is vsed
to the rudderhead:/




the Coller; 
Is that rope which is made fast about the BeakeÂ­
head, wherevnto the dead-man Eye is seased
vnto which the mayne staye is fastened There
wch is called a Coller or a Garland & is
there placed to save the shroudes from gallinge




the Combe
Is a smale peece of tymber sett vnder the lower
parte of the Boate head neere the middest wth



Two holes in it and is iust in the Nature and hath the
same vse to the fore tackes, that the Chieftrees hath to
the mayne tackes which is to bringe the Tacke a board;/




Compasse
Is that moveable instrument with a Flye whereon
are discribed the 32 poyntes or wyndes by which we direct
or Steere our Courses att Sea: The fashion is 
knowne to all, and for the vses they are handled 
at Large in many bookes which write of Navigacion 
There are 3 kindes first the playne Meridionall 
Compasse, which is the ordinarie one: The second 
a Compasse of Variacion which shewe the variacion
of the Compasse form the true North and South
The Third is adarke Compasse which beinge but an
ordinarie Compasse in vse, is only soe called because
the Flye hath the poyntes soe discribed with noe 
collours, as the other have, but only with blacke and
white beinge most Convenient to be seeme when 
wee Steere by night wthout anie light but only 
starrlight;/




To Cond or Cund
I thinke this word comes of Conducere in latine
for it importes as much as to leade or direct the 
shipp which waye she shall goe It is Commonly pronounced
thus Cun the shipp, which implyes as much as to
direct him att the Helme, how to steere in longe 
Courses, when wee are off att Sea There is not
soe much heede taken of it for then they direct 
their Course vpon a poynt att the Compasse and
soe lett him att the helme looke to Steere right
on that poynt of the Compasse: There the Master
Mate or some other standinge aloft doth give 
direceccion to him att the Helme, and this wee call
Cundinge or Cunninge: Sometyme hee whoe 
Condes the shipp wilbe speakinge to him at
Helme att every little yawe, which the Seafaringe
love not as a kinde of disgrace to their 
Steeridge: Then in mockinge they will saye sure
The Channell is narrowe he Condes soe thicke


 
whereby you may gather that in Narrowe
Chanells it is necessarie and vsuall to Cond
thicke Note that accordinge as the shipps
sailes are trymed either before or by a wynd
soe they vse seuerall termes in Condinge and to
vse other were vnproper, and rediculous 
a mongst them If ashipp goe before a wynde
or as they terme it, betwixt two Sheates: Then
he whoe Condes vseth these termes to him att the
Helme Starrbord: Larbord the Helme amiddes
shipps: Note that when we say Starbord, the
meaninge is that he must putt the Helme to 
the Starrbord side and then the shipp will goe
to the Larbord, for the shipp doth over goe
contrary to the Helme If the shipp goe by 
a wynd and quarter wyndes They saye Alloofe
or keepe your loofe or fall not off weare noe more
keepe her to have a Care of the Lee latch: 
Touch the wynde All these doe implie, the
Same in amanner and are to bidd him at the
Helme to keepe her neere the wynd Ease the
Helme no neere; Beare vpp; these wordes doe
appoynt him to keepe her from the wynd, and
make her goe more large or right before: 
Some speeches are Common to both as steddy
That is keepe the shipp from goeinge in and out
But iust vpon the poynt that you are to 
Steere, and as you goe, and such like;/




Cooke roome
The Cooke roome is the place where they 
dresse there victualls, and this Roome is to 
be placed in diuers places in the shipp according
to the shipps imployment: In Marchant 
men whoe must imploye all their hold for the
stoweinge of their goodes, and soe stowe all 



victualls betwixt their deckes it is best to have the Cooke
roome in the forecastle especially beinge Contrived
in furnaces for the saveinge of wood in longe 
iorneyes as alsoe for that in feight they bringe their
Sterne and not their Prowe to feight And 
therefore wilbe the lesse discommodious to them
Besides they doe not carry soe much ordinance wth
them forward on: And therefore the weight of 
the Cooke roome is not soe offensive But in a 
Man of warre: It is most Convenient to have
it in the foreshipp or fore Castle: My reasons
are these First That it wilbe (be it placed aswell
as it cann be) hinder the vse of the Ordinance:
Secondly it will lye over the Powder: Thirdly
beinge a Man of warr that pretendes to 
feight with his Prowe; That parte is likelyest to 
receive Shott which if anie chance to come 
amongst the Brickes of the Cookeroome They
will spoyle more men, then the shott: And
besides the Cookeroome it selfe (for the voyage)
is spoyled there beinge noe meanes to repaire
it att sea, and then they must needes vse an other
Soe that I thinke noe man of discretion will 
Command or vse that for most sufficient which is
most subiect to be destroyed and Cannot bee
repaired: Fowerthly A man of warr ever
Carryes much Ordinance there, and thereÂ­
fore it is fitt to avoyd as much as may be
anie waight that may charge her foreshipp
Fifthly it is dangerous for fyreinge the shipp 
for beinge made vp to the shipps sides soe that
men cannot goe round about in longe continuÂ­
ance and much heateing they may fyre the
shipp as vn awares Sixthly it takes awaye
the grace and pleasure of the most imporÂ­
tant, and pleasantest parte of all the shipp
For anie one whoe comes abord a Man of 
warr will principally looke at the Chase



beinge the place where the Cheife offensive
force of the shipp should lye And to Conclude
I doe not knowe anie Commoditie it can give
to a Man of warr; wherefore in my 
oppinion the Best placeinge the Cooke roome
is in the Hutch waye vpon the First Orlope,
not in the hold as the kinges Shipps doe wch
must needes spoyle all the victualls with toÂ­
much heatinge the hold, or the leastwise force
them to stowe it soe neere the Stem & Sterne
That it must wronge and wringe the shipp
much and loose much Stowage: And it 
beinge there placed (as it doth a voyd all 
former inconvenience both of the hold and 
fore Castel and yet shalbe as serviceable 
Soe hath it this benefitt more That it doth
Wonderfully well ayre the shipp betwixt the
deckes which is a greate health vnto the ComÂ­
panie: But if I were to goe to sea: as a Man
of warr I would have noe Cookeroome at
all but such a on as I would have contrived to
be removed and strooken downe in howld if I
lift and yet should wast noe more wood 
then these doe, and dresse sufficient meate
for the Company, and Roste and Bake some
Compleate companie for the Commanndr
Or anie person of qualitie;/




Cordage
All kind of Ropes belonginge to the Rigginge
of a shipp is by a generall appellacion called
Cordage;/




Cownter
Is that hollow Archinge parte in the shipps
sterne betwixt the Transome & the lower parte
of the Gallery which is called the lower Cownter
The vpp Cownter is from the Gallery to the
Lower parte of the vpright of the Sterne;/





Course
Is taken for that  poynte of the Compasse
wch the shipp is to sayle vpon: As to saye the
place we must now goe to lyes East: we then
direct our Course East Alter the Course:
That is saile vpon an other poynt of the Compas
Mistake the Course: That is not to knowe how
the land lyes which waye to goe. Alsoe Mayne
Course, and fore Course, and Missen Course
Are the sayles wthout the Bonnettes Note
All shipps of great Burthen have double 
Courses to hold more wynd and give the 
shipp more waye in a fresh gale but in an
Easie gale they hinder as doe all thinges that 
are waightie over head;/ 




a Crabb
Is an engine of wood with 3 Clawes placed
on the ground iust in the Nature of a CapÂ­
ptayne, beinge placed and most Commonly 
vsed where they buyld shipps: for the Launching
out or heaveinge in of a shipp in to the decke
or off the Keg;/




a Cradell
Is a frame of tymber brought a longst the
outside of the shipp by the Bildg wherein
they doe launch Shipps for the greater
safetie; In Spaine and other places 
they vse to tryme all their great shipps
in them;/




Craft
Is anie kinde of Nettes or lynes or hookes to Catch
Fish: For at Sea they will saye when they have lost
their lynes or Nettes: That they have lost their
Craft wee alsoe call smale vessells : As Ketches
Hoyes, Craes, and such like, smale Craft &
he that sailes in them we saye he vses smale
Craft;/





Cranck
We saye a shipp is Crank sided when she will 
beare but smale ayle, and will lye downe very 
much with side wyndes. The cause whereof is that
her breath beinge layd to lowe she hath noe thinge
to beare her vpp, when once shee begins to heele
Wee alsoe saye she is Crancke by the ground, when
she cannot be brought a ground but in danger to 
over throwe: The reason whereof is she hath noe
Bilge to beare her her flores beinge layd to 
narrowe; / 




Creengles
Are little Ropes spliced into the Boltropes
of all sayles belonginge to the Maine and 
foremast vnto which the Bowleinge bridles are 
made fast And they are alsoe to hold by when 
wee shake off a Bonnett;/




Crossbarr;
Is a round shott with a Barre of Iron as it were
putt through the middle Comynge out at both
endes some 6 or 8 inches more or lesse This will
not flie soe farr as a round shott but farther 
then a Langerell or a Chayne shott: It is very
good to vse in feight for the Cuttinge and 
spoyleinge of Ropes, sayes, yardes & Mastes, as
alsoe to doe Execucion a mongst men where 
they stand plyinge their smale shott But
it is not vsed vnder water for that it will 
hardly goe through a good shipps sides vnlesse
it be vsed out of very great Ordinance;/




Cross-iack
Is a yard at the vpper-End of the Missen
mast vnder the Topp: and there is slunge 
haveinge noe Hilliardes nor tyes belongeinge to
it, The vse whereof is to spread and hale on
the Missen top sayle sheates;/






Crosse Peece
Is that greate Peece of Tymber which goes a Crosse
the Bitt pipes and is that wherevnto wee belaye
the Cabells;/




Cross=trees
Are those Crosse Peeces of tymber which are sett
on the head of the Mast beinge bolted and lett 
into an other, very stronge, In a generall appellacion
all those fore peeces beinge soe made & putt toÂ­
geather are called the Crosse trees, But in
truth and more strictly all those Two peeces 
wch goe Thwart shipps are called the Crossetrees
and the other which goe longst shipps are called TressÂ­
trees: The vse whereof is to beare and keepe 
vpp the Topp Mast for the foote of the ToppÂ­
Mast is fastened in them, soe that they beare all
The stresse, These alsoe doe beare vpon the Topp
And doe necessarielye belonge to all Mastes which 
Carry anie other, Top or Flagstaffe at the head;/




Crowe feete
Are those small lynes or Ropes wch
stand in Sixe, Eight, Tenn or more partes
beinge soe divided and putt through holes of 
a deadman-eye, They are of noe necessitie But
only sett vpp by the Boate-swaynes to make 
the shipp to showe full of smale Rigginges and
are placed to the Bottome of the BackÂ­
stayes of the Fore Topmast, Sprit-sayle
Topmast Missen, Topmast and the Topgallant 
Mastes;/




Cubbridg Head
Is the same that is a Bulke head: only 
that wee vse these wordes to the Bulkehead 
of the Fore-castle, and the halfe Decke
wch wee call the Cubbridg head before or



the Cubbridge head abast;/




Culvertaile
Is a manner of lettinge one Tymber into an

Cuntinge.
The hollowe Concauitye betwixt the
Strands of the Roapes is called the CunÂ­

Strond Roapes, for Roapes made of 4
Strandes lye smoother togeather, & Closer
so that tis little perceiued. the are alÂ­
waies made of 4 Strand Roapes, because they
are smoother to run in the Hownd, then three

Cutt
This word is vsed in this sense, Cutt the
saile; That is when men are a loft vpon the
yard The Mayne saile or Foresaile beinge
farthelled vpp they must lett it fall downe
When a saile is well fashioned, they saye it is well Cutt; Cutt the Cabell in the Hawse -
That is most commonly vsed when we ride in some
storme, and desire to sett saile but Cannot stay
the weyinge of the Anchor for feare of driveinge
tomuch to Leeward or the like, generally vpon
anie occation when we cannot staye the weying
of the Anchor, Then wee cutt the Cabell in 
the Hawse, to save soe much as wee can of it
In extraordinarie occasion either att an Anchor
or att Sea, wee some tymes cutt the Mastes att
the Bord The cause att an Anchor is when
the storme increaseth soe that the power wch
the wynd hath vpon the Rigginge & the Mast
doth force her Anchor to come home or else
endanger the breakinge of the Cabell Then
they Cast downe the Mast, But if there be
only a greate Seagale and little or noe wynd
There it is to noe purpose to Cutt the Mast
for they doe little or noe hurt; This happens
in many places where the wynd doth not blowe
home, as att SaintSe Cruse in Barbarie where
such have rid such a Roade that the Sea hath
broke over their fore Topp and yett not a breth 
of wynd: Att sea they Cutt the Mastes on these
occasions: When an extraordinarie Gust
or Storme, hath soe layd the shipp on saile that
there is noe hope, that she can right a gaine



and soe would quicklie be over sett or fild with 
water: Then in cuttinge the Mast, first Cutt the
Lee shrowdes, for else when the Mast is over bord
it wilbe hard Cuttinge them and the end of the
Mast may chaunce beate out the shipps sides,
next Cutt a little into the weather side of the 
Mast, and then Cuttinge the weather shroudes
The Mast will instantly and wthout anie 
Dangerfulle over Bord; Likewise at Sea 
in a greate Storem where the shipp rowles
much: If the partners give waye the Mast
will roule out the shipps sides: In this case alsoe
if they cannot be mended, The Mast must
be Cutt by the Bord;/




Cuttwater
The Cutt water is the sharpenesse of 
the shipp before which doth as it were Cutt the 
water and divide it before it comes to the 
Bowe, soe that it maye come by degrees and
not to sodenly to the breadth of the shipp 
otherwise the shipp would beate soe full against
the water, that she would make but little
waye; And therefore many tymes when 
a shipp is to Bluffe we putt to a false Stemme
and as it were lengthen her forward on, and
this we call a Cutt water, which will not only 
make her sayle better but alsoe make her 
much a gainst a headsea:






D

the Dauitt
Is a peece of tymber haveinge a Notch
at one end whereon they hange a Blocke
by a Strape and this is only vsed for to 
hange the Blocke on which is Called the the fishe
Blocke, by which they hale vp the Flooke of 
the Anchoor to the bowe or Loofe; It is shifted
to either side as they have occasion and 
is not made fast to the shipp butt layd by
till it be vsed It is putt out betwixt the Catt
and the loofe: Launch out or Launch in the
Davitt: That is putt it out or in alsoe the 
Boate hath a Davitt which is sett out over the
head of the Boate with a sheever into which 
they bringe the Boye Rope to waye the 
Anchoor, and it standes in the Carlinges which are
in the Boates bowe;/




Deadmen-eyes
Are a kinde of Blockes wherein there are
many holes, but noe sheevers, wherein the 
Lannyers goe, that make fast the shroudes to the
Chaines; The Mayne staies in some shipps
are sett taught by Laniers in deadmen-Eyes
but most greate shipps vse double Blockes
the Crowe feete doe reeve through deadÂ­
men-Eyes;/




Deadwater
The water which is the Eddy water at the
sterne of the shipp is Called deadwater
and therefore wee saye a shipp holdes much 
dead water; That is which hath a greate Eddy
followes her att the Sterne or Rudder and 
this may be called dead because it doth not
passe a waye with that life and quicknesse 
as the other doth;/




Deck
The decke is that floare or Plancke wherein wee
place our Ordinance: It lyes vpon the Beames
they are called by the names of First second



and Third decke beginninge att the lowest Alsoe 
there is the halfe decke That is the decke which is
from the Maine Maste to the Steeridge, and 
quarter decke which is from the Steridge aloft to
the MMasters Cabbine: There is alsoe a spare decke
wch is the vppermost betwixt the two Mastes
and is made very sleight with a nettinge or sleight
bordes to wardes the sides of the shipp & agrateinge
in the middest Alsoe these deckes are called by the
names of Orlopes As they vse to saye the
first and Second Orlopp: A Flush decke
or as they vse to saye a deckeflush foreaft 
That is when from Steme to Sterne it lyes 
vpon a right lyne wthout anie fall; Note that
the best contriveinge of a man of warr is to 
have the decke flush and to have all the Portes
in that decke of an equall height soe as anie
Peece maye serve anie parte, The reasons are
for that the deckes beinge flushe men maye
passe fore and aft with much more Ease for
the deliueringe Powder and shott or releiveinge
one an other But cheifely for that if a Peece
or two be dismounted by shott, in anie place
where there is a fall, an other cannot be 
brought to supplie ites place, besides the discomÂ­
moditie by disioyninge the equall parte of the
shipp; The shipp is much weakened and alsoe
it looseth much stowage in the Sterne Sheates
yett there maye be some vse of these falls to
a Marchant Man for his defence whoe maye
fitt a Close feight out of every fall, and 
thought he loose one parte of the decke yet he may
still keepe more to be gayned from him; The
decke cambers, That is when it doth not lye
flatt, but Compassinge To sincke a decke or
to lett sinke a decke is to remove it and 
place it lower; To rayse a decke is to put
it higher a bove water The makeinge
of a decke is termed the layinge of a 
Deck




 
 
Deepe sea-lead
Is the Lead which is hunge att the seaÂ­
lyne to sincke it downe: The weight 
where of is Commonly 24 lb This hath some
white hard tallowe layd vpon the lower
End which bringes vpp the ground, and soe
by the differences of the ground wee 
knowe where and vpon what Coastes wee
are: But in Ooze ground wee vse a white
woollen cloth vpon the lead with a little
Tallowe with out which Cloth the Ooze would 
Not sticke vonto the Tallowe;/




Deepe sea Line
Is a smale lyne with which wee sound in deepe
waters to finde ground and soe accordinge
to the depth and ground in many knowne 
places, as in the Comeinge into our Channell
and many other places when wee cann see
noe land yet wee knowe where we are;/




Disimbogue
Is as much as to saye to come out of the mouth
of anie Gulfe which beinge large wthin may 
have straight and narrowe comeinge out, beinge
vsed thus; when they come out of the westÂ­
Indies betweixt Cuba, and Cape Florida, 
wch is the straight whereout the Current
doth sett. They saye they disimbogud out of
the Bulke, But it is not vsed for the goeinge 
out of a Harbor or the like;/ 




Dispertinge
To dispert is to fynd out the difference of 
The diameters of Mettalls betwixt the Breech
and the mouth of anie Peece of Ordinance
By which wee knowe, what allowance to give to the
mouth of the peece beinge ever lesse then the
peeces Breech That thereby we may make a



iust shott There are divers wayes but the playnest
is the surest and best which is by puttinge in
of a strawe or smale sticke at the touch hole to 
the lower side of the Concave or Sillender of the
peece And then applie it in the same manner
to the mouth And it will exactly shew the 
difference of the thicknesse of the Mettaile att
the Breech and mouth of the peece;/




Dock;/
There are Two kindes of dockes a drye docke
wch is made of Fludgates to keepe out the Tyde,
in which we buyld our shipps and repayre them
in which wee sitt wthout danger & harme, The 
other is a Wett decke which is anie Creeke or
place where wee may hale in a shipp out of
the tydes waye in the Ooze And there when 
a shipp hath made her selfe as it were a place
to lye in wee say the shipp hath decks her selfe,/




a Drabler,
Vide  Bonnet for this is in all respectes
the same to the Bonnett, that the Bonnett is
to the Course; This is only vsed when the Course
and Bonnett are to Showle for to Cloath the 
Mast: Some smale shipps which are Coasters
and therefore are for most Conveniece to 
have short Courses, doe vse Two drablers, 




Draggs
Any thinges that hange over the shipp att
sea as shirtes, gownes and the like, as alsoe the
Boate in that respect, All which doe hinder 
the shipps waye vnder sayle, are Called dragges,




Draught,
By draught in water is ment soe many 
Foote, as the shipp goes in water, A shipp 
drawes much water That is goes deepe in



water:  a shipp of smale draught, That
is drawes but little water Note that shipps
of greate draught are Commonly wholesome
shipps in the sea; And shipps of little draught
Commonly goe best but Rowle most: The First is 
Best for a longe voyage the last for a discovery,/




a Dredge.
Is an Engine wherewith they take vp
Oisters out of the Sea being made
of a frame of Iron sharpe at the bottom
and a verie strong Nett of a small comÂ­
passe fastend to it, to Contayne the Oysters
or anie thing else which the Iron rakes of
the Grownd.

to Dredge,
Or dredginge is to take a little Grapnell wch
beinge hunge over the Boates sterne, we lett downe
to drage vpon the grownd to finde a Cabell wch
hath bin lett slipp vnto whose Anchor there was
noe Buoy for this passinge a longe the ground
as the Boate doth rowe will Catch hold of it, if it
meete with it;/ 




a Drift saile
Is saile vsed vnder water beinge veered out
right a head haveinge sheates to it, the vse whereof
is to keepe a shipps head right vpon the Sea
in a Storme, alsoe it is good where a shipp 
drives in fast with a Current, to hinder her driveinge
in soe fast But it is most Commonly vsed by 
Fishermen in the North seas;/




Driue
We saye a shipp drives when we lett fall the 
Anchor and it will not hold the shipp fast, but
that she falls a waye with the tyde or wynde; 
for which we have noe helpe, but to veere more
Cabell; For you must note, that the more Cabell
Is out The faster and surer a shipp will ride; 
Or else to lett fall more Anchor, alsoe when 
a shipp is a Hull or a Trey, we saye she drives to
Leeward or drives in with the shore, And the
like accordinge to the waye she meetes;/




Duck vp
This terme is vsed with the Clewe Garnett
and Clewe lynes, of the maine saile for sailes
and spritt sailes when as the Maine saile or fore



saile doth hinder the feight foreward that Steeres,
or anie the like occasions: And to the spritt saile
most Commonly when we make a shott with a Chase
peece for the Clewe of the spritt saile, will 
hinder the feight, and beinge not duckt vpp wilbe
shott awaye, soe then wee saye ducke vp the 
Clewe lynes;/






E

Earinge
Is that parte of the Bolt Rope which at all the Fower
Corners of the saile is left open as it were a Ring
The two vppermost are putt over the endes of the
yardes or yard armes, and soe the saile is att
those two endes made fast to the yard into the 
lowermost; The Tackes and Sheaths are seased
or (as the more proper terme is) They are
bent vnto the Clewe;/




To Ease
This word is vsed in the same sense at Sea,
as otherwise wee vse the word slacke; For 
generally when we would have anie Rope
slacker and not soe hard strayned, we saye
Ease the Bowlinges Sheates &c.: Only when the
Tacke should be slackened; The proper Terme
is lett rise the Tacke, which is a very fitt Terme
in respect That the Tacke beinge loosed it rises
vpp from the Chestrees vnto which it was haled
Close;/




an Eddie
Is the runninge backe of the Water in some 
place contrary to the Tyde and soe fallinge
into the tyde againe which happens by reason 
of some head land or greate poynt in a River
Comeinge out soddenly, and soe hinderinge 
the Free passage of the Water which it had
in the Channell before it come to this poynt,/




an Eddie water
Is the wynd which recoyles or returnes backe from
anie saile, Hawse or the like goeinge Contrary
to that wynd whence it proceeded, But is never
soe stronge as the other;/




End for End
That is a terme vsed when anie Rope doth runne
all out of the Blocke; That it is unreeved or



as when a Cable or Hawser doth runne all out
att the Hawse, which may happen either of purpose
to save the Cabell, or by Chance when Comeinge
to an anchor, if they should Mislayinge of the 
Stoppers, or that the Stoppers should breake
Then they saye: The Cabell is att Hawse 
runn out End for End 




Enter
To enter is to come into a shipp But in feight
they must be carefull to Cleere the deckes wth
fire Pottes or the like if it be possible from the
Traynes of Powder before men doe enter For
it happens many tymes, That there are more
men left in a minuit By enteringe then in 
longe feight Bord & Borde and therefore
beinge soe dangerous it is fitt that men should
bee well advised first: though many tymes, if
a shipp bee not well provided of Close fieghtes
it is the spediest & safest waye of takeinge 
them;/




Entring Ladder
Of theses there are two, the one which is vsed
by the shipps sides in harbor, and faire weather
wth entringe Ropes to it: This is all made of
wood, the other is made of Ropes with smale
staves for steps, which is hung over the Gallery
for enteringe out of the Boate in fowle 
weather, when by reason of the shipps heaveinge
and settinge, They dare not bringe the Boate
to the shipps sides for feare of Staveinge;/




Entring Rope;
Is the Rope which hangs by the side of the shipp
in the wast where men doe vsually come 
a Board the shipp out of the Boate But it
is taken generally for anie Rope which is given
a man to Enter by:/





Eies
The hole wherein the Ringe of the Anchor
is putt Called the Eye of the Anchor: Alsoe
the Compasse or Ringe: which is left of the 
Strapp wherevnto a Blocke is seased is -- 
called the Eye of the Strapp;/




Eylett-holes
Are those round holes a longst the Bottome
of the sailes vnto which doe belonge Bonnettes
and the Bonnettes have the same for the 
drablers: They have a little lyne sowne a boute
them, to make them stronge, and are for noe
other vse, but to receive into them the Latchettes
of the Bonnett or drablers with which The Bonnett
is laced to the Course and the drabler to
the Bonnett:






F

Faddom
A Faddome is 6 foote, which though every one knowe
I sett downe to give notice, that wee measure the
length of all our Ropes by Faddomes and not by 
anie other measure as we doe the Compasse
of the Ropes by inches, For wee waye a Cabell
or a Hawser of soe many Faddome longe 
and soe many inches about; Alsoe wee 
reckon in soundinge by faddomes;/




a Fake
Is one Cirkle of anie Rope or Cabbell that is
Quoyled vp round; And soe when wee Veere
out a Cabell, They many tymes aske to knowe
how much is left behind wthin Bord; How many
Fakes are left;/




Fall off
When a shipp vnder saile doth not keepe soe
neere the wynd as wee apoynt, wee saye that
the shipp Falls off: This happens many tymes
by the Steeres-mans negligence But sometymes
the fault is in the shipp, which happens either
because shee may be to light a head, or that her
Mast may be stayed too forward for these two
thinges doe make a sheepes head fall from the
wynd;/




Falls
When wee mencion the falls of a shipp, as
to saye a shipp hath a Fall or many Falls it is
ment by the raiseinge or layinge some parte
of the decke higher or lower then the other
Alsoe the smale Rope, which we hale by in all
Tackles, is called the Falle of the Tackle 
as to saye over hale the Fall of the greate
Tackle only the wyndinge Tackle hath noe
Fall;/





the Fashion 
Peeces;/
Are the two tymbers which doe discribe the breadth
of the shipp a Sterne, and are the outwardmost
Tymbers of the Shipps sterne on either side 
excepting a loft where the Cowneere is Counted;/




Fender Bolt --
Vide Bolts




Fenders
Are anie peeces of old Cabells, or Ropes or 
Billettes of wood which are hunge over the ships sides
to keepe an other shipp or Boate from rubbinge
on the shipps sides; That they maye not breake her
 Bendes, or rubb of the stuff, when she is new
trymed: Boats have the same to save them from
much beatinge against the ships sides: In the Boate
the men have little short Staves which they call
fenders: Hence we saye fend the Boate, that
is save her from beatinge against the ships
sides;/




Fidd:
Is as it were an Iron pinn made Taperinge
and (as it were) sharpe att the lower end, wch
is for to open the Strandes of the Ropes when
wee Splyce two Ropes to geather; But when
wee splice Cabells wee vse Fiddes of wood in
the same Forme and nature but much bigger
wch if they were made of Iron would be too 
heavie to worke wthall The pinne of the heele
of the Top mast which beares it vpp on the 
Chestrees is a Fidd;/




Fiddhammer
Is a Fidd made sharpe at one end to splice a
Rope with a hammer at the other end with a head
And a Claw to drive or drawe anaile;/




Feights
The mast Clothes which hange round about the shipp
to hinder men from beinge seene in feight



are called the Feightes Alsoe anie Bulkhead afore 
or abast out of which they may vse murderers
or smale shott, or generally anie place wherein
men may Cover them selves, and yet vse their
Armes are called Close feightes;/




Fire-workes;/
Are anie kind of Artificiall receiptes applied
to anie kinde of Gudgine, weapon or instrument
Whereby we vse to sett on fire, the Hulls, sailes
and Mastes of a shipp in Feight, whereof there are
many sortes, but the most Commonly vsed att sea 
are these, Fire Pottes, Fire-bales, Fire Peekes,
Trunckes, Brasse balls, Arrowes with fireworkes
and the like; To saye all that might concerninge
these will require too longe a discouse for this
that I heare pretend;/




a Fish
Is anie peece of tymber or Plancke which we
make fast either to Mast or yard to souccoure &
strengthen it when it is in danger to breake
Then wee Command the Carpenter; to fish
the Mast or yard, which is done First hollowinge it
fitt for the place, and then nayleinge it
wth speekes, and wouldinge it a bout with 
ropes: This Fish is very drye meate;/




the Fish 
Is a Tackle hunge at the end of the davitt by
the Strape of the Blocke, in the Blocke there
is a Runner with a hooke att the end which doth hitch
the Flooke with the Anchor and soe they hale by 
the fall that belonges to it and soe raise the Flooke
to the Bowe, or Chaine wale of the shipp:/




Fish-blocke
It is the Blocke that belonges to the fish and
is called the Fish-blocke;/





Fish hooke,/
Is likewise the hooke belonginge to the Fish 
And is called the Fishhooke;/




Flaggs;
There is only vsed att sea for distincion of 
Nations, or officers of Fleetes; As that the
Admirall should have his in the mayne topp
the vice admirall in the fore And the 
Reare Admirall in the Missen Topp; But alsoe
for distincion, and signes what shipps must doe
accordinge as they have direccions from the
Cheife Comaunnder, as to Chase or to give
over, to come to Councell or the like Att sea 
to Lower or Strike one flagg in feightinge is
taken for yeildinge: But otherwise of greate 
obedience and respect: And to be made to 
take it in per force, the greatest disgrace that
cann be; when they would have the Flagg out
they saye heave out the Flagg, and take in the
Flagge or Farthell the Flagg, That is wrapp
it Close about the Staffe: To strike the Flagg
is to pull it downe vpon the Capp and soe 
lett it hange over loose;/




Flaire
When ashipp is alittle howsed in neere the 
Water, and a bove that the worke doth hange
over a gaine, and is layd out broader aloft, 
They saye that the worke doth flaire over 
this makes ashipp more roome wthin board
for a Man of Warr, But it is not slightly nor
by the most Common oppinion held to be holson for ashipp
Yett I have scene the experience and anie of
oppinion, That is cann wronge a shipp butt
little; If her beareinge be layd high enough;/




Floane
When anie of the sheates are not haled home to the
Blockes: Then they saye the Sheate is Floane: 
But when they say lett the sheate That



is to lett it goe a maine or as farr as it will This 
is most Commonly vsed in greate gustes for feare
of Spreadinge the Top Mast, or over settinge the
shipp, for the Seates beinge flowne the saile
doth hold noe wynd: I have seene in an extraordiÂ­
narie wynd, that when a shipp hath layne downe
on the quick side in the water, we have to make
her right a gaine, lett flye the sheate, but the 
Gust hath Flitted all the sayle to peeces 
leavinge not anie iott or but some ragge in 
the Bolt ropes;/ 




Flood
It is Flood when the water begins to rise younge
flood: quarter flood; half Flood are all the
Termes Comonly knowne;/




the Flooke
This is the Brod parte of the Anchor which takes
Hold in the ground: As alsoe those in the 
Grapnells, which have Fower Flookes;/




Floate
We saye anie thinge doth Floate that swymes
above water, not touchinge ground; As the
shipp is afloate, That is when it is borne vpp
Cleere from the gournd, by the riseinge of 
the water: A floatie shipp, is a shipp wch
draws but little water;/




Flowe
When the water doth rise or heighten we say
it doth flowe: But note that it doth ever 
in all places seas or Rivers where it doth flowe,
Flowe before the shore, before it flowes by 
the offinge or Middle of the Streame and 
soe it doth Ebb by the shore before it doth in
the streame The reason is for that the water
is of most force and weight where it is deepest
and soe is hardlyer reformed beinge once bent 



anie waye when wee saye it flowes at London
Bridge Southwest, or attaine other place
South or West or as it happens: By this
is ment That when the Moone is att the
Full, or else new Moone, Then vpon that
daye the Sunne beinge in the South west
poynt which is 3 a Clocke in the afternoone
it is height water at London Bridge;/




the Floare
The Floare of the shipp is soe much of the
Bottome of her as she doth rest vpon when
she is a ground And therefore those wch
have longe and broad floares lye best and
safest with the ground and the others are
Crancke and dangerous both the wringe 
them selves, and to overthrowe;/




Flush;
When a decke is layd from stem to stem 
wthout anie falls or rysinges; we saye her decke
lyes flush, fore and aft, and this word is not 
vsed in anie other sense;/




the Flye,
Is that part of the Compasse, whereon the 32
poyntes of the wyndes are discribed to which vnderÂ­
neath is the Needle made fast;/




to Free
When a shipp hath much water wee saye she 
wantes Pumps to free her: Or when wee bale
out the water, That is called freeinge the shipps
Alsoe when the Boate hath water in her wee
Command them to free the Boate: Soe that
this word Free is not vsed in anie other 
respect a boute a shipp, but to gett out the 
water, nor there is not anie other word vsed
soe properly for the gettinge out the water in a 
shipp or Boate, as this;/




Free-shott,
When anie extraordinarie land waters come
downe a ryver sodainly, or else when anie greate
 


ryver comes into a Sea, soe as that the water
is Fresh a Myle or two, as in many places it
is we say it is a greate Free shott;/




the Forefoote
There is noe such parte of a shipp which is termed
herefore foote: But it is aword vsed in this
kinde when two shipps saile, soe that one doth
lye with the Steme soe much a weather the
other, That keepinge their Courses, That shipp
wch doth soe lye will goe out a head of the other,
Then we saye, that she doth lye with the forefoote
of the other as she standes or comes with her foreÂ­
foote: But beinge once soe past out before her 
ahead, and by her wee doe not saye, she is past
by her forefoote, But thus she is gone out 
a Head: Soe that this word fore foote implies
a Crosse, an other shipps waye;/




Forelockes,
Are little flatt peeces of Irone made like
wedges, which are putt into the holes at the endes
of Boltes to keepe the Boltes from draweinge
out or slypinge backe, Alsoe these keepe 
downe and fast the Capsquares of the 
Carriages;/




Fore mast,
VideMast 




Fore-reach
When Two shipps sayle togeather, or after
one an other, she which sailes best, that is fastest
doth forereach vpon the other: If Two shipps
saile both on waye by a wynd one may keepe
the better wynd, The other maye forereach, Then
he that doth fore reach, if he would speke wth
the other (as suppose he be amann of warr
the other a Marchant he must cast a boute 



he is soe farre reached of her that he may
lye with her forefotte;/

Fowle
When a shipp hath binn longe vntrymed soe
that grasse or anie filth be gott aboute her 
she is fowle, Alsoe when anie Rope which we 
should hale is hindred by anie other or tangled
in it selfe as Topsaile; Halliardes, Tuckle 
Falls or the like may be, or anie thinge else 
soe that it cannot runne, we saye the Rope
is fowle, as the sheates are fowle of the 
Ordinance, the Halliardes, Clewe lynes 
or the like, are fowle, and soe must be Cleered
Before they can be made to Runne;/




Foulewater
When a shipp vnder saile comes into shallowe
water, soe as she rayses the Mudd, or sand
in her waye, which she maye though she doe not
touch the ground, but come verry neere it
wee saye she makes fowle water, when she
sayles with her keele neere the ground, canÂ­
not feele her helme, soe well as in deepe 
water. The reason is for that neere the ground
The water hath not that weight & force as
it hath where it is deepe, And alsoe by 
reason of an Eddie, which is made betwixt the
ground and the Bottome of the shipp, being
soe neere to geather, The water cannot come
soe swift to the Rudder as it doth in deeper 
waters Note that the swifter the water comes



to the Rudder the better a shipp doth steere or
feele her helme:/




Founder
When a shipp by an extraordinarie leake or
else by anie greate Sea: that broke into
her is halfe full or full of water, soe that we
cannot free the water forth we saye she
is Fowndered, The word is significant , for
iust as a Fowndred Horse cannot goe soe 
a shipp is full or neere full of water will 
not feele her helme; That is will neither
Veere nor steere bu drive a waye with the
sea iust like a logg of wood:/




Furr or
Furd;
There are two kindes of Furringe the one
Is after a shipp is built, to laye on, an other
Plancke vpon Plancke, The other which is 
more Eminent & more properly furringe
is to Ripe vpp the First Planckes and
putt other tymbers vpon the First, and
soe to putt on the Planckes vpon these 
tymbers: The occations of it is to make a 
shipp beare a better saile for when a shipp
is too narrowe, and her beareinge not layd
out enough or too lowe, Then they must make 
her broader, and laye her beareinge heigher
They Comonly Furr some 2 or 3 streakes 
vnderwater And as much above accordinge
as the shipp requires more or lesse I thinke
in all the world there are not soe many ships
furd as are in England, And it is pittie 
there is noe order taken either for the 
punishinge of those whoe buyld such shipps
or the preventinge of it for it is an infinit
losse to the owners, and an vtter spoyleinge
and disgrace to all shipps that are soe
handled;/





Futt hookes
This word is Commonly soe pronounced, But
I thinke more properly it should be called 
Foote hookes, For the Futt hookes are the
Compassinge tymbers which give the breadth
and beareinge to the ship, which are scarfed to 
the ground Tymbers: And because noe tymbers
that Compasse cann be found longe enough to 
goe vpp through all the side of the shipp
These Compassinge tymbers are scarfed one
into an other, And these next the keele are called
the lower or ground Flotthookes, The vpper
other are called the vpper Futthookes;/




Furthell;
Or Farthellinge a saile, is when wee wrapp
vpp a saile Close togeather, and soe bynd it
wth the Caskettes to the yard, but towardes the 
yard armes we vse Rope yarnes, for the saile
is not very weightie, This manner wee vse
only to the mayne saile, Fore saile, and 
spritt saile;/




Furthellinge
lynes,/
Are smale lynes, which are made fast to all the
Topsailes, Topgallant-sayles, and alsoe, the 
Missen yardes armes, The Missen, hath but one, The
other on either side, By these we furthell those
sailes, But the top sailes have not the Buntt bound
vpp to the yard, as the Maine and fore sailes
have but is layd in the topp, and soe bound fast
to the head of the Mast this wee call Stowinge
the Topsaile:/




A former
Is a peece of wood tunred round somewhat
lesse then the bore of the Peece for which it is 
made, as a Saker foremer, a Minion former &c..
The vse whereof is to make it vpon a paper 
Carthrages or lynneon Carthrages;/






G

Gage
We vse to Gage our Caske that we may see how 
greate it is, or how much it is leaked out, which we
doe by puttinge downe a sticke at the Bunge, and
that by the wetnesse will shewe how much liquor is in
it: Alsoe when wee would knowe how much water
a shipp drawes when she is a floate we strike 
a Naile into a pike or Pole and soe putt it downe
by the Rudder; Till this naile catch hold vnder the
Rudder and this we call Gageinge the shipp Note
that we cannot exactly by this tell how much water
she drawes for we must allowe for the Racke of
the shipp aftward on, for the Pole doth not goe 
downe in it Perpendiculerly, And soe many foote
as shee drawes is called the shipps gage, when 
one shipp is to weather of an other; she hath as
they terme it the weather gage But they neuer 
vse to saye the Leegage;/




Gale
When the wynd doth not blowe to hard, but reaÂ­
sonable soe that ashipp  may beare her topsailes
a Tryppe, we call it accordinge to the strength
of it, either an easie loome gale which is when it is
much wynd, somtymes at Sea Two shipps 
beinge not farr a sunder If it be fine smooth 
gentle weather, and but little wynd, one shipp
will have more wynd then an other, and somtymes
the one be flatt becalmed the other have alittle
Breadth of wynd, Then they saye, The shipp wch
hath the wynd doth gale a waye from the other,/




the Garbord;
Is the first Plancke that is putt or brought 
on the outside of the shipp next the Keele





Garbord-streake
Is the First Streake or as you may saye 
the First seame next to the Keele, here is
the most dangerous place in all the shipp
to springe a Leeke for it is allmost impossible
to come to it wthin bord;/

Ordinance &c. It hath a Pendant comes from
the head of the Maine Mast, with a Blocke 
wch is strongly seased in the Maine staye
iust over the Hutch waye, where wee vse to take
in our goodes to hold; In the Blocke they doe 
Reeve the Runner which hath a Hooke att one 
end, with which wee hitch the Slinges, att the 
other a double Blocke in which wee Reeve the 
 Fall of the Runner, and soe by that we 
hale and hoise in the goodes when it is not vsed 
it is made fast alonge by the staye, at the 
Bottome of the staye:

Girt
When the Cabell is soe taught that vpon the
turninge of the Fidd the shipp cannot goe over

saye she is gyrt, which will instantly be vndone 
if the Cablell be Veered out slack;/




Goareinge
A saile is Cutt Goareinge when it comes sloopeinge 
by degrees, and is broader att the Clewe then at
the Eareinge. All Topsailes and Top gallant



sailes are soe;/




Goose wyng;
When wee are goinge before a wynd or quarter
wyndes with a faire fresh gale, wee many tymes
to make more hast, vnparcell the Missenyard
and soe Launch out the yard and saile over the
quarter on the Leeside: and so fittinge Guyes
att the Further end, to keepe the yoord Steddy
wth a Boome wee Boome out the sheate of 
the Missen saile, This doth helpe to give the
shipp some waye which otherwise the Missen 
saile will not especially before a wynd: This
saile soe fitted is called a Goose winge;/




Grapnells;/
Are in nature of Anchors beinge vsed for 
Gullyes or Boates to ride by, only they differ in
forme for a Grapnell hath Fower floakes, and
never a stocke for it needes none, beinge the wch
waye soeuer it fall two of the flookes do ever hold
by the gournd, In men of warr, we vse them
that are height to slinge into a shipp to catch
hold of some of her gratinges, Railes, Gunn walls
or the like And soe haveinge a Chayne made 
fast vnto it, we lash fast the shipps togeather
There are alsoe smale Grapnells with Three
hookes, but not broad like flookes which wee
vse to sweepe for hawseres, or smale Cabells;/




Gratings;/
Are smale ledges layd on a Crosse an other
like a percullis or a Prison gate; Those wch
are called the Gratinges are betwixt the 
Maine and Fore Mastes, which doe serve for a close
feight and alsoe for the Souccor of men either
in too hott, or too fowle weather, with a TarrÂ­
pawlinge vpon them. There are alsoe in 
many places of the shipp Gratinges made



for Ayre and light but Cheifely over OrdiÂ­
nance for the vent of the smoke of the Powder
wch comes out of the Touch hole, in feight;/




to Graue
Graveinge a shipp is bringinge her to lye
drye a ground, and then to burne off the old
filth and Stuffe with Reede, Broome, and the
like and soe to laye on newe: Some wee only
Tallowe, but that will quickly growe fowle 
Others tallowe & sope which will alsoe quickly growe
fowle The most Common and best is with 
trayne oyle, Roson and Brimstone boyled toÂ­
geather For this will last longest, Cleane,
The layinge on of this Stuffe is called 
payinge The shipp;/




a Gripe
The Gripe of the shipp is the Compasse and
sharpeness of the Stem vnder water: especially
towardes the lower parte the vse whereof is, to make
ashipp keepe a good wynd; And therefore some tymes
when a shipp will not keepe a good wynd They 
putt to another falce stemme to the true Stemme
to make her Gripe more;/




to Gripe,
We saye a shipp doth gripe, when she is apt
contrary to the Helme, to Runne her head or 
Nose into the wynd more then she should There
are Commonly Two causes of this: The one when
a shipp may be too deepe a head; That her head
be not apt by reason of the weight which preses
her downe, to fall a waye from the wynd: The
other may be the stayinge of her Mast: For 
if she be ashort shipp and drawe much water;
If her Mass be stayed to much aftward on;
it will cause her head still to Runne into the
wynd The Flemmings beinge generally long



floatie shipps, doe staye all their Mastesaftward 
on very much else their shipps would never keepe
a wynde: For it is apparent to sense, that all 
sailes, from the Maine Mast, Aftward on; the 
farther Aft they stand, the more they keepe the
shipp to the wynd, as the head sayles the more
forward on they stand; The more they have power
to flatt the shipp about from the wynd;/




Grometts,
Are little Ringes which are made to the vpp
side of the yard, with staples which are dryven inÂ­
to the yard which have noe other vse but to tye &
make fast the Caskettes vnto them;/




Ground &
Groundinge,
When a shipp is brought of purpose to be trymed
on the ground or otherwise: That is called 
groundinge of the shipp: There are Three
manner of layinge a shipp a ground; That is
either layinge her head vpwardes towardes 
the Bancke, and her Sterne, towardes the 
Offward; And is termed layinge her PitchÂ­
Longtoo, This is vsed to shipps that are Cranke
wth the ground, for this waye they take the 
best advantage for a shipp to beare her selfe
The second is to laye her all allongst the 
shore, and to Heele her to the shore-ward; This
is vsed to shipps which have reasonable good floares
and will beare them selves sufficiently well 
The third is layinge her a longst the shore,
And Heeleinge her to the Offward; This we
vse to shipps, which have greate broad and longe 
flores, as Fleminges which have standinge Streakes
The reason is for that otherwise wee should 
hardly come to her Keele: Some Sea-fareing
men, are very supersticious of goeinge to Sea
at Certayne dayes & Commonly they hold it good
to begine the voyage of Sundaye, And thereÂ­
fore to seeme to have begunn the voyage 



though they be not readie to goe, That daye 
they will way or (as the Terme is) trypp the 
Anchor, and goe a little waye and soe goe to 
Anchor againe; this they call breakeinge
ground;/




Ground tymbers
Are those tymbers which are first layd vpon 
the keels, and soe bollted through the 
keelson into the keele, and are those which make
the floare of the shipp, and are therefore 
called ground tymbers, because the shipp - 
doth rest vpon these, when she lye a ground;/




Gudgins --
Are those Irons which are made fast to the sterne
Post, and which the Pintills of the Rudders are
hanged to;/




To Gull
When the Pinn of a Blocke doth eate or weare
into the Sheever, it is Called Gullinge, Alsoe
when a gard doth rubb a gainst a Mast, wee 
saye it will Gull the Mast, And therefore
to avoyd that we putt a platt made of Synnett
to the Middle of the yard to keepe it from 
Gullinge the Mast;/




the Gun-wale
That peece of tymber which reacheth on either 
side the shipp, from the halfe decke to the 
Fore Castle beinge the vppermost Bend (as it
were) which finisheth the vpper workes of the Hull
there, and wherein they putt the Stannchions 
wch support the Wast-trees is Called the Gunnwale,
whether there be anie gunns there or not: Alsoe
the lower parte of anie Porte where anie OrdiÂ­
nance doth lye is Called the Gunnwale;/




a Guy
Is anie rope which is vsed to keepe a peece of 
Ordinance or anie thinge else, the Boate or
the like, which is hoised into the shipp from 
swinginge into the shipp to fast when it is over



the Gunnwale to be hoysed in by them by this
Rope wee doe ease it in gentlie, and it is -- 
Commonly made fast to the Stantions of the
Wast-trees: And that is called a Guy, wch
word I thinke comes from Guyde for this 
doth guyd it in: Alsoe there is a Rope which is 
fastened to the fore Mast att one end and is
to the Pendant of the wyndinge Tackle; 
and soe reeved a gayne through an other 
wch is seased to the Fore Mast somewhat lower
then the first parte: And this is to hale forward
the Pendant of the wyndinge Tackle, and 
this Rope is called a Guye 






H

the springe or
Springe tydes;/
When after the dead neapes, the tydes beginne 
to lift, and growe higher, we saye it is springe
wherevpon Three dayes before the full and 
Change of the Moone, the springe begins, &
the Topp or highest of the springe is 3 daies
after: Then the water doth heigh most with the
flood, and lowe mast with the Ebb which is the 
reason, that att these tymes wee Launch 



and ground all our greate shipps: The 
tydes alsoe runn much stronger & swifter
then in the Neapes;/

Spunge,
The Spunge of a Peece of Ordinance is 
That which make it Cleane: The are Commonly 
Shipp skinnes putt att the end of a Staffe, wch
is made some what bigger there accordinge
to the Bore of the Peece, soe as the Spunge
may goe in full and Close, but not to straight
But we have it alsoe fitted to thee endes of a stiffe
roope, soe is the Rammer alsoe to spunge &
lade wthin bord: wee ever Spunge a peece
of Ordinance before we putt in powder 
In feight when the Ordinance is plyed fast
to keepe it from heatinge we wett the 
spunges: Vrin is the best, but else with vynneger,
Water or what we have;/





Spunn yarne,
Is rope yarne endes scraped Thynne
and Spunn on to the end of an other wth
a wynch, and make it as longe as they lift
This serves to sarve some Rope wth: But
most Commonly it is made to make Caburne of 




Spurketts
Are the holes or spaces betwixt the Futtockes
or betwixt the Runges by the shipsides before
and Aft, above and belowe, To the Spurketts
belowe in Holde, which are belowe the Sleepes
there are bordes fitted which they take vp to
Cleere the Spurkettes if anie Ballast
gett in betwixt the tymbers: But for those
allof there is noe vse, only it were good they
were in all shipps fitted vpp with light wood
or olde Iunckes to keepe the ships sides aloft
Muskett free;/




Standinge parts
of Runninge ropes/
The standinge partes are those partes of 
Runninge ropes, or rather that end of
a Runninge rope which is made fast to anie
parte of the shipp to distinguish it from the
other parte whereon wee vse to hale as 
the standinge parte of the Sheate is that
parte which is made fast by a Clynch into a 
Ringe, at the shipps quarter and the 
like for when wee saye hale the Sheate 
That is ment by the runninge parte: But
if they saye over hale the Sheate: Then
they hale vpon the standinge parte: The 
same is of all Tackles & Runninge Ropes;/




Stand in ropes
Are counted all those Ropes, as the shrowdes



stayes and Backstayes  which are not vsed to bee
removed, or to runn in anie Blockes: But 
are only sett taught, or slacker as they have 
occasion;/




bringe a shippa
Staye;/
When wee Tacke the shipp before it can bee 
ready to be Tacked, she must come a stayes:
That is when the wynd comes in att the Bowe
wch was the Lee bowe before; and soe drives all
the sailes backward against the shrowdes and
Mastes, soe that the shipp hath noe waye, but
drives with the broad side: The manner of doeinge
it is att one tyme, and togeather to beare vpp
the Helme; Lett flie the Sheate of the fore saile
and lett goe the fore bowlinge, and brase the 
weather Brases of the foresaile; The same to
the Top saile, and Top gallant saile, only they
keepe fast their sheates, If the Spritt saile be
out, then they lett goe the Spritt saile sheate
wth the fore sheate, and Brase the weather 
Brase: The Tackes; Sheates, Brases, Bowlinges
of the Mayne saile, Mayne top saile, & Myssen
standinge fast as they did: To be taken a Stayes
That is when the wynd, comes contrary on the
soddaine, which happens most vpon headlandes
or Calme weathers, and soe bringes the ship
a Stayes: Some tymes by the Negligence
of them att the Helme: Sometymes if it be 
little wynd and a head sea, on the weather 
bowe a shipp may Mysse Stayinge that is to 
fall backe, and fill againe The best Condicioned
ships are those which staye with least sayles 
As with two Top sailes, or Fore top sailes and
Myssen: But noe shipp will staye with lesse
sailes then those, and fewe with soe little;/






Staies & Backstaies;/
All the Mastes, and Top Mastes and Flagg
staves have stayes exceptinge the Spritt
saile Top  Mast, the Mayne Mast 
staye is made fast by a Lannyere to Coller
wch comes a bout the Knee of the head: The
Mayne Top Mast staye is made fast to 
the head of the Fore Mast, by a Strap and
dead-man-eye there: The Mayne Top gallant
Mast is in like manner to the head of the 
Fore top Mast: The Fore mast, and Mastes
belonginge to it are in the same manner
staid att the Boltspritt. The Myssen saile 
comes ot the Mayne Mast by the halfe decke
and the Top Mast stayes come to the Shrowdes
wth Crowe feete: The vse of these stayes is
to keepe the shrowdes from fallinge Aftward
to wardes the Pumpe there is much difference 
in stayinge of Mastes in respect of ships 
sayleinge, or workinge generally: The 
more Afte the Mastes hange, The more a 
shipp will keepe in the wynd and the 
forwarder the lesse: The Flemminges 
staye their Mastes much Afte because else 
their shipps beinge longe floatie shipps, 
would neuer keepe a wynd: But short and
deepe shipps rather Covett vpright Mastes
ther are may differences of Condicoions in 
shipps for their sayleinge accordinge as they 
are stayes: For some will have the staye taught
some slacke: The Buckstayes of all Mastes
wch have them Those are only the Mayne Mast
and fore Mast, and the Mastes belonginge to 
them, goe downe on either side the shipp and
are to keepe the Mast from Pitchinge ForeÂ­
ward on over Bord;/






the Sterne,
All the After most parte of the shipp is called
the Sterne by a generall appellacion: But
most exactly considered only the very outwardÂ­
most parte Abast is the Sterne: For the 
Quarter is Counted to be from the Steeridge
to the Transome and Fashion peeces of the
Sterne;/




Stearne sheate,
Vide Sheats;/




Steere,
Is to governe the ship with the Helme Hee
Steeres best, that keepes the Shipp evenmost
from yawning in and out; and alsoe that vses
least Motion in puttinge the Helme too farr over
There are three kinde of direccions to Steere by
The one is by the Land, that is to Steere by anie
marke on the land, and soe to keepe the shipp
even by the marke: This is easie: The next is by
the Compasse That is to keepe the shipp vpon
a poynt of the Compasse This is hardder because
the ships head will come before the Compasse:
The third is to Steere as they are directed and 
Conded: This is easiest of all: If you would knowe
The termes belonginge to Steereinge Vide Conde;/




the Steeridge
Is the place where they steere out of which they
Maye see the Letch of the sayles to sea: If 
They be to the wynd or not;/




the Stem;/
The steme of the shipp is that greate 
Tymber which comes Compassinge from the
Keele where in it is skarfed vp before the 



fore Castles: This it may be is not all one
Tymber, as in greate shipps it Cannot: And
this doth give the Rake of the shipp when 
shipps stand stem for stem they come right
wth their heades one a gainst an other: To 
give a shipp the Stem: That is to runne right
vpon her with the Stem: To goe Stemminge 
a bord a shipp: That is the same as giveinge
the shipp the stemm;/




a Stepe:/
they Call the peece of tymber which is made
fast to the Keelson wherein the Mayne Mast
doth stand a Stepe: Alsoe those places and
tymbers wherein the Mysson Mast, Fore Mast
and the Cap staines doe stand, are Called 
Steps:/




to Steue or Steuinge;/
Wee saye the Bolt spritt or Beackehead steves 
when it standes too vpright, and not straight
forward enough Alsoe the Marchantes Call
the stoweinge of their Cottons, which they force
in with Scrimes soe much that the decke will
rise 6 or 8 inches, steuinge of Cottons;/




 Stewards roome,
Is that parte of the holde wher the victualls
are Stowed;/




Stoaked,/
When the water cannot come to the well, 
Wee saye the shipp is Stoaked, and that is
When the Lymber holes have some Ballast
Or anie thinge else gott into them soe as



that the water cannot passe, wee saye the
Lymbers are Stoaked: Alsoe when anie tying
is gott in or a bout the Bottome of the Pumpe
soe that it cannot drawe water, we say the 
Pumpe is Stoaked: Corne and the like
Is very badd for this,/




Stopp;
When they come to an Anchor, and have
lett runn out as sufficient quantitie as will
make the shipp wide, or that the shipp be in a
Current, wher it is best to stope her alittle
by degrees then they saye Stopp the shipp
and soe hold fast the Cabell, and then veere
out a little more and soe stopp her fully to lett
her ride: for Stoppinge leake Vide Leakes;/




Stopper;/
Is a peece of a Rope haveinge a wale knote
att one end and a Lannyer splyced to it And the
other end made fast to some porte, as the stoppers
to the Cablles the Bottomes of the shipps by
the decke: The Stoppers for the MaineÂ­
Halliardes to the knight: The vse of them is 
Cheifely for th Cabells, to stopp the Cabells
when wee come to an Anchor, that it may goe
out by little and little: The manner is, but,
 byndinge the wale Knott a bout the Cabell
wth the Lannyer, and it will instantly Catch
hold in it, soe that it cannot slipp a waye 
as the nippers doe with holde of the Cabell 
The terme is layinge on the Stoppers, and 
Castinge of the stoppers, alsoe wee vse them
to the Halliardes when the yard is hoised aloft, to
stopp it til the Halliardes are belayd: A shipp
rides by the stoppers when the Cabell is not bytted
but only held fast by them: But this is not
safe rideing in stresse;/





to Stowe;/
Is to putt anie goodes in hould in order: For
else we saye it is not Stowed, but lyes in holde
Alsoe we call it the Stoweinge betweene the
deckes if anie goodes or victualls be placed
in order vpon the deckes: But it is not vsed
in this kinde to smale thinges, as to a Chest
or the like: Alsoe the placeinge or layinge
of the Top sailes, in the Topp, is called the
Stoweinge of the Top sailes; /




a Streake,
Is their terme for a Seame betwixt two 
Planckes as the Garbord-a-streake, Or the
Heeles a streake, that is one Steame some 
shipps are built with a standinge streake
or two: that is when they have the whole
breadth of a Plancke or Two ryseinge from
the Keele before they come to the Floare 
tymbers These shipps are made lye wth
the ground for wringinge their Keeles 
But this doth make them keepe an excellent
Wynd: This buylt is most vsed a mongst
The Fleminges;/




a Strapp;/
A rope which is spliced a bout anie blocke,
that the Blocke may thereby be made fast
to anie place where they have occation
to vse it, by the eye which is made in the 
Strape in the Arse of the Blocke;/




Streame Anchor,
Is a smale Anchor which we vse to the
Streame Cabell;/






Streame Cabell
Is a smale Cabell which wee ride wthall in Stremes
or ryvers, or in faire weather, when wee stopp
a tyde for ever wee vse the smalest ground, 
Tackle that we have if it will serve, both for
lightnesse to waigh, and to save the best from
wettinge;/ 




Stretch;/
They vse this word not as it is Commonly to strayne
a Rope: But thus, when they goe to hoise a 
yarde or hale the sheate; they say Stretch
forward the Halliardes or the Sheates That
is deliuer a longe that parte which they must hale
into the mens handes that they may be 
ready to hoise or hale;/




to strike;/
is to pull downe the sailes; when one shipp
strikes to an other, it is a signe of respect 
vnlesse it be fore occasions of stayinge for one
If a man of warr come vp with a Marchant
or anie other: If he strike it is intended that
he yeeldes himselfe Alsoe when a shipp is beate
vpon the ground, they saye she strikes; soe 
when wee take downe the top mastes, we say strike
them downe soe when wee Lower anie thinge
into the Houlde with the Tackles or anie other
rope wee call it strikeinge downe into the
houlde;/




Studdinge
sailes;
Vide Boome;




Sturrop;
When a shipp by anie Mischance hath lost 
a peece of her Keele, and that we cannot come



well to mend it; but as it were Patch a newe
peece vnto it: the bynde it with an Iron wch
comes vnder the Keele and soe vpon either
side the shipp, where it is nayled very strong
wth speekes to Strengthen it: This peece
soe putt to the Keele wee call a Storrop;/




Suck;
When all the water is Pumped out, and
that the Pumpe doth drawe wynd, we saye
she suckes Alsoe when a shipp doth drawe 
downe the Helme and doth (as it were) sucke the
Helme staffe out of the hand att the helme: A
shipp Gripps when she doth thus, The Reason
maye be either much fowleness, The stayinge of
her Mastes too  much Aft, or that she may
be out of her Trymm;/




Surge
We call a wave a Surge, but it is vsed in this
sence when they heave att the Capstaine, and
the Cabell slipps back a gaine, they say the
Cabell Surges: To prevent which Vide Nippers;/




Swifters,/
Doe belonge to the Mayne and Fore Mast
and are to Souccour the shrowdes and keepe
stiffe the Mast: They have Pendantes which 
are made fast vnder the shrowdes att the 
head of the Mast with a double Blocke through
wch is reeved the swifter, which att the standÂ­
inge parte hath a single Blocke with a hooke wch
is hitched in a Ringe, by the Chaine wales
and soe the Fale beinge halde doth helpe
to strengthen the Mast, and this Fale is
belayed a bout the Tymbers heades of the 
lower Railes;/






Swiftinge
When we bringe shipps a ground or Carrene
them we vse to Swift the Mastes to ease them
and strengthen them which is done in this 
manner: They Lash fast all the Pendantes
of the Swifters and Tackells, with a Rope
Close to the Mast, as neere their Blockes
As they came: there they carry forward the
Tackles, and soe Bowse them downe, as hard
and as Taught as they came, and this 
Eases the Mast soe that all the waight of 
the Mat doth not hange by the head as other
wise it would: And alsoe doth helpe to 
keepe it from riseinge out of the Stepps;/






T

Tacks;/
Are greate Ropes haveinge a wale knott
att one end which is seased into the Clewe of
the saile, and soe reeved first thorugh the 
Chestrees, and then comes in att a hole 
att the shipps sides: the vse of this is to carry
forward the Clewe of the saile, and to make
it stand Close by a wynd, and then the sayles
are thus Trymmed: The Maine Tacke
foresaile and Missen Tackes are Close 
a bord, or haled as forward on as may be
soe are the Bowlinges of the weather side
The Lee sheates are haled Close aft but 
the Lee sheae of the fore saile, not soe much
vnlesse the shipp gripp: the Lee Brases 
of all the yardes are brassed aft, And the
Top sailes are governed, as the sailes where
vnto they belonge And hence they saye 
a shipp standes or sayles Closse vpon a Tacke
that is Close by a wynd Hale a board The
Tacke; that is to have it Close to the Chestrees
Ease the Tacke, that is not soe Close abord
Lett rise the Tacke, That is lett it goe all 
out: It is Comonly belayed to the 
Bittes or else there is a Kennell that belonges
to them: These Tackes doe only belonge 
to the Maine saile, Fore saile, and Missen
and they are ever more Taperinge;/




to Tack a 
Shipp;/
To tacke the shipp is to bringe her head
a boute to lye the other waye: As if her
head laye First, west Northwest, Now
it must lye East-North-east, the wynde 
beinge att North, then supposeinge a ship
hath all her sails out which wee vse by a 
wynde, this wee doe first we make her staye



(for which Vide a Staye) when she is stayed then 
wee saye she is payd and soe lett rise and hale
That is lett the Lee Tacke rise and hale Aft 
the sheates: And soe trymme all the sailes by 
a wynd as they were before: That is Cast of
the Bowlinge, which was the weather Blowing
and now sett vpp taught the other: And soe 
all sheates, Brases and Tackes as a shipp that
is trymmed by a wynd must have;/




Tackels
Are smale ropes which runne in three partes 
haveinge either a Pendant with a Blocke to 
it or a Runner: and att the other end a 
Blocke and hooke to Catch holde and heave
in goodes into the shipp: There are these 
maine sortes vsed That is the Boate tackles
wch stand on the Maine Mastes shrowde, the
other in the Fore Mast shrowdes to hoise in 
the Boate, and doe serve alsoe for other 
vses: The Tackles which belonge to Mastes
wch serve in the nature of shrowdes to keepe
the Mast from strayinge; The Gunners tackles
wth which they hale in and out the Ordinance,
And lastly a wyndinge Tackle, which Vide wyndinge Tackle
The rope of a Tackle, is called the fall:
That part which wee hale vpon But the end
wherevnto the Blocke is seased is called
the standinge parte: to hale vpon a Tackle
is termed to Bouse vpon the Tackle;/




Tallee
When they hale Aft the sheates of the 
Maine or fore-saile, they say Talley aft
the sheates;/





Tamkin;/
Is anie smale peece of wood turned fitt 
for the mouth of anie Peece: which is putt
in there to keepe out the rayne or SeaÂ­
water from washinge in when the Peeces
lye wthin Bord;/




Taperinge,/
Is when anie Rope or anie thinge else is made
bigger att the one end then at the other as 
the Tackes are made taperinge, which makes
them purchase the better, and save a greate
deale of stuffe, because the Rope att one end
beares little or noe stresse; I have seene in
Flemminges the Top saile sheates taperinge,/




Taper-bore,/
Is when a Peeces Bore is wyder att the mouth
then towardes the Breech: Some are of 
 oppinion that these peeces doe not
recoyle soe much: But they are not soe 
good: for some tymes if the shott be too thicke
it may be it will not come home to the 
Powder, which is dangerouse for the Peece;/




Tar-Powlinge;/
Is a peece of Canvas that is all Tard over
to laye vpon a Decke or Gratinge to 
keepe the rayne from soakinge through;/




Taught;/
That is sett a Rope stiffe, and fast, as
we saye sett taught the shrowdes; The
Staye or anie other Rope when it is
too slacke;/





Taunt
When a Mast is very high for the perporcion
of the shipp, we saye it is a Taunt Mast
The Flemminges have them soe for the most
parte For Taunt Mastes and Narrow yardes
are best to saile by a wynde, for the sailes
stand soe much the sharper: But yet they 
wringe a shipps sides more then a short 
Mast, and a broad yard, which is the reason
our shipps vse short Mastes & Broad yardes;/




Tempest;
When it overblowes soe exceedingly that
it is not possible to beare anie saile, and
that is is a wynd mixt with raine or haile,
they call it a Tempest which they Count 
a degree a bove a storme;/




the thoughts
Are the seates whereon those that Row
in the Boates doe sitt;/




Thight;
When a shipp is Staunch and makes but 
little water she is Thight, which is quickly 
knowne by the smell of the water, for if the
water stinke much it is a signe it hath layne
longe in the shipe: and if it be sweete 
it is a signe it comes in newely;/




Thowles;/
Are the smale Pinnes, which they beare 
against with their Oares when they Rowe: And
stand in holes vpon the vpperside of the 
Gunnwall of the Boate: They are 
Commonly made of Ash wood for Toughnes;/





Thwart-ships;/
That is anie thinge that is done or lyes a Crosse 
the shipp from one side to the other, we saye it
lyes Thwart shipps and the Contrary in Longst
shipps: That is alonge the shipp;/




Tides
This word Tyde is Common both to the Ebb and Flood
it is called Tyde of Ebb as well of as Tyde of
Flood a wyndward Tyde is when the Tyde runns
against the Sea: then the sea breakes most and
goes highest but a shipp att Anchor Straines 
the Cabells least: A Leeward tyde, that is
when the tyde and wynde goe both one waye: Then
the sea is smoother, a Tide gate, That is where
the tyde runnes stronger, To tyde it over or vp
to a place That is to goe with the tyde of Flood
or Ebb; and soe stope the Contrary tyde wth
an Anchor till the same tyde come againe, 
and this is vsed when the wynd is contrary 
butt doth not overblowe, for then they cannot
stopp att an Anchor, and if they keepe vnder
a saile they  will leese more in one Leeward
tyde, then they shall gett in two wyndward tydes
when they saye flowesflowes tyde and halfe tyde
in anie place, the meaninge of it is thus (for
the speech is most vnproper to Common vnderÂ­
standinge, imployinge asmuch as if it did 
flowe a tyde and ahalfe in some places 
togeather and but halfe an ebb) that the 
tyde doth runn Three howers which is 4 poyntes
longer in the Offinge then it doth by the 
Shoare: by longer is not meant fower 
howers for it doth ever Ebb and Flowe
Sixe howers: But this If it be high water
at the Shoare by Twelve a Clocke, it shall
not be high water in the Offinge till it bee
Three a Clocke, which is the Compasse and



tyme for the runninge of halfe a Tyde: Soe
accordinge as it Ebbs or flowes more
they saye it runnes, Tide halfe and halfe
quarter that is Five poyntes: when they
come into an Harbour or over a sand,
They saye they will bringe their Tide
wth them: That is to come with the Flood
wch may carry them over: Note that when
it flowes tyde and halfe tyde; that though
the tyde of Flood runne aloft yett the
tyde of Ebb runns vnder foote, that is close
by the ground, and soe the tyde of Ebb it
will flowe vnder foote;/




Ties;/
Are Fower strond Ropes Hauser layde wch
is in respect that this kinde of layinge 
doth not stretch soe much as Three strond
ropes and besides runne smoother in the 
honndes: these are the Ropes by which the
yardes doe hange, and doe carry vp the yardes
when the Halliardes be strayned to hoise the
yardes, The Maine yard and fore yard ties 
are first reeved through the Ram-heades, then
through the honndes att the head of the Mast
and soe with a Turne in the eyes of the slinges
 which are made fast in the yardes, they are
seased fast and Close in the yard: The 
Missen yard and Top mast-yard have but
single Ties, That is one doe runn in one
parte: The Sprit saile yard hath none for
it is made fast with a parie of slinges to 
the Bolt spritt;/





the Tiller;
The Helme and the Tiller is allone ThereÂ­
fore Vide Helme only the word Tiller is 
most properly vsed for that wch wee Steere
the Boate by, as they say give me the Tiller
of the Boate not the Helme, yett it is all
one in vse;/




a Tire;/
When a decke hath Ordinance for and Aft
though there want some, wee call that 
a tyre of Ordinance; Some shipps 
have two Tyre or Three; The forecastle
and the halfe decke beinge furnished make
halfe a Tyre, The Cabell Tyre; That is 
the Rowe which is in the Middle of the Cabell
when it is Quoyled vp:/




Top armers,/
Are the Clothes which are tyed about the
Ropes of the Mastes for shewe, and alsoe for
to hide men in feight, which lie there to 
slinge fire bolees, vse smale shot or the like;/




Top gallant;/
Are the Mast a bove the Top mastes, these
sailes doe drawe very much water wyndes
in a Loone or fresh gale soe it blowe not
to much;/




Top mast;/
The Topmastes are ever halfe soe longe
as the Mast to which they belonge: But
there is noe absolute proporcion in these 
or the like thinges, for if a man will have
his Mastes short, he may the bolder make
his Top mast longe;/






Top-ropes
Are those Ropes wherewth wee sett or 
strike the Topmast: they belonge only to
the Maine and fore Topmast: This Rope
is Reeved through agreate Blocke, which is
seased vnder the Cap, on one side, and then it
is Reeved thorugh the Heele of the TopÂ­
Mast where is a Brasse sheever which is placed
Thwart ships, and then it is brought vp and
made fast on the other side of the Cape wth
a Clinch to a Ringe which is fastened to the 
Cap, the other parte Comes downe by the 
Tries, and soe is Reeved in the Knight and 
brought to the Cap staine when they heave
it;




to Towe;/
Is to dragg anie thinge a Sterne the shipe in
the water, as to Towe the Boate, or to Towe
a smale shipp or the like with a Hawser out a 
Stearne: The neere anie thinge is to the 
Boate or the like when it is Towed the lesse it
doth hinder the shipps waye, but the further 
off the easier it is for that which is Towed for
then the shipp will not give is such Twitches;/




Transom;/
That tymber which lyes a Thwart the Stearne
of the shipp, be twixt the Two fashion peeces
and doth laye out her breadth att the Buttocke
is called the Transom this is most vnder the 
Gunnroome Porte a Stearne to lye with a ship
Transom: That is to lye iust with the Planckes
where they are fastened to the fashion peece
a stearne, To come to a ships Transom That
is iust betwixt the Gunnrooome Porte and
 her quarter Porte: This is the safest, 



cominge vp: for there shipps are most naked
and there Gulleyes doe vse to come vp But
now they begin to Cutt out Portes close by the
Transom:/




Trauers;/
We call the waye of the shipp in respect of
the poyntes wherein wee saile, and the Angles
wch the shipp makes in goeing to and a gaine the 
Travers of the shipp: As wee say a Man doth
Travers his ground when he goes in and out: 
wee vse to note how many howers a shipp hath 
gone vpon a Poynte, what sailes she hath forth
how neere a wynde, and soe iudge what waye she
makes This we sett downe vpon a paper besides 
the Platt which we call a Travers, and Then 
drawinge a Lyne from the place where we last
weare to that place where the alst pricke or 
marke is we see in the whole, what course &
how farr wee are gone: This we call a dead
recconinge: Then if we can observe and finde
the observacion, and this meete we are sure we 
are right otherwise we trust more to the obserÂ­
vacion and reforme our reconinge by that Alsoe
the layinge and removeinge of a peece of 
Ordinance till it come to lye with the marke 
Is called the Traversinge of the Peece;/




Trauers-bord;
Is a board which they keepe in the Steeridge 
haveinge the 32 poyntes of the Compasse marked
in it with little holes on every poynt like a noddy
board: This is for him att the Helme to keepe
as it were a score how many glasses they 
have gon vpon of the Compasse and soe 
sticke a pinne of that poynt This is to save
the Master a laboure whoe Cannot with soe



much Curiositie watch every wynd and Course
soe exactly as he hath att Helme, especially
when wee goe by a wynd, and the wynd veers
and hales;/




Tree nailes;/
Quasi Nailes made of a Tree are the long
woodden Pinnes made of the harte of Oake
wherewth they fasten all the Planckes vnto
the Tymbers for though wee Bolt the 
Buttheades for the better asureance and 
strenght yett the Tree nayles are they wch
doe most fasten the Planckes for wee doe
vse as little Iron vnder water as we may
Conveniently, least the shipp should growe 
Iron sicke: These tree nayles must be well 
seasoned and not sappie for then the shipp
wilbe Continually Leakie and it wilbe hard
to finde: If a shipp by anie beatinge of 
the ground doe make or give backe, or 
come a little out a gaine: They terme it 
Startinge of a Tree naile;/




Tressell-trees
Are ioyned to the Crosse trees and doe
lie Close each other and serve to the same
vse They differ only That the TressellÂ­
trees are those which goe longst ships The 
other Thwart Ships Vide Cross trees;/






To Trice;/
Is to hale vp anie thinge with a dead Rope
That is when wee hale by a Rope that doth not
runn in anie Blocke, or hold vp by anie 
device but by hand As if an emptie Caske
be made fast to a Rope, that is noe Tackle
they saye Trice it vpp: Or anie Chest or like
goodes which is fastened to a Rope, and soe haled
vpp by hand into a shipp, we call it haleinge
by hand when wee have not the helpe of anie
Capstaine, Tackle or the like, which might purÂ­
chase easier, but only doe it by the ymediat 
and only force of handes;/




To Trie;/
Tryinge is to have noe more saile fore 
but the Maine saile the Tacke a Bord, the BowÂ­
linge sett vpp, the sheate close Aft and the 
Helme tyded downe close a Board Some trye
wth their Missen only, But that is when it blowes
soe much that they cannot maynteyne the Maine
saile A shipp a Trye with her mayne saile 
except it be an extraordinarie growne Sea,
Beame, But with her Myssen not soe much;/




the Trim
Though Commonly by the Trymm of the shipp 
is vnderstood the Swymminge of her either a head
or a stearne, or on an even Keele, In whether
of these the shipps goes best, that they Call her
trymm But that is not only to be Counted
her Trymm for some shipps will goe well or ill
accordinge to the stayinge of the Mastes, the 
slacknesse of the shrowdes or the like: Therefore
in my mynd, That order of her Swyminge conÂ­
sidered with this fittinge of her Mastes and Ropes
wherein the shipp sailes best should bee counted 



her Tryme and not only the Lyne of her swymÂ­
minge in water: The wayes of fyndinge a 
shipps Tryme must be in saileinge with an
other shipp to bringe her a head soe many 
glasses, Then a sterne as many, then one
even Keele and that waye which she goes
best is her Tryme in respect of her mould
vnder water then to make her goe better
ease the stayes or sett them vpp alsoe the
shrowdes Then wedge the Mast or give it 
leave to playe, and soe in tyme it is eased
wth a little diligences, to Fynd, the Tryme 
of a shipp next to man of warr to finde
it whose daylie practice it is, The 
Scotchmen are the best in the world 
for they will neuer be quiett butt trye her
allwayes, and if there be anie goodnesse
in her they will make her goe;/


Catchword on the previous page, "her tryme", not completely carried over.




the Trough
of the Sea;
That is in the hollow betwixt two 
waves when wee laye a shipp vnder the
Sea: That is when wee laye her Broad
side to the Sea wee saye she lyes in 
the Trough of the Sea;/




Truncks,
Are those little woodden wheeles beinge
Made wthout anie Spoakes that the
Carriages of the Ordinance doe 
runne on: Alsoe those little round 
thinges of wood which belonge to the 
Parrells are called Truckes,/






Trunnions;/
Are those Knobbs which come from the side
of the Ordinance and doe beare them vpp
vpon the Cheekes of the Carriages;/




Trusses;/
Trusses, are Ropes which are made fast to
the parparcell of the yardes and are vsed to
two vses, one to bynd fast the yardes to the
Mastes when she rowles either a Hull or at
Anchor; The other is to hale downe the
yardes in a Storme or Gust These beÂ­
longe only to the Mayne yardes and fore
yardes, and they are brought too but vpon
Occation And alsoe to the Myssen which 
hath ever a Trusse;/




the Tuck,
The word is significant for it is as you
would saye the gatheringe vp of the ships
quarter vnder water: If it lye lowe that
makes the shipp have a flatt quarter
and hinders the water from passinge 
swiftly to the Rudder: If it lye high the 
shipp must be well layed out in the quarteer
else she will want beareinge for her after
workes which beinge soe high and weightie
doe charge a shipp much;/




to Turne;/
Vide Board:






V

Veere;/
To veere out a Rope is to putt it out by 
hand or to lett a runn out when as you may 
stop it as Veere more Cabell That is lett
more runne out: Veere it is generally vsed
to the letting out more ropes to those ropes
wch are vsed wthoutboard as to the Boate rope
logg lyne or anie Rope whereby wee towe any
thinge but it is not vsed to anie Runninge Rope
but only to the Sheates: Veere more sheate
that is putt out, when the wynd doth goe
in and out That is some tymes to one 
poynt some tymes to an other and that 
soddaynlie as in the storme it will very 
much they say the wynd doth Veere and
Hull/




Veereinge
When a shipp sayles and the Sheate is Veered
Out wee saye she goes Veereinge, Vide 
large and Quarter wyndes for it is all 
one;/




a Violl
When the Anchor is in such stiffe ground that
we cannot weigh it, or else that the sea goes
soe high that the Mayne Capstayne cannot 
purchase in the Cabell: Then for more helpe
we take a Hawser & open one Strond And soe
putt into it Nippers some 7 or 8 faddome 
distant from each other, and with these Nippers
wee bynd fast the Hawser to the Cabell, and
soe bringe the Hawser to the Ieere Capstayne
and heave vpon it; and this will purchase
more then the Mayne Capstayne cann:
The vyall is fastened togeather att both
endes with an eye and a walle Knott or else
wth two eyes seased togeather;/






W

To Waft
To waft is to guard anie shipp or fleete at
Sea; As wee call men of warre which Conduct
Marchantes safe a longe, wafters Alsoe es 
Are tearmed when they make signes to have the 
Boate come a board which is a Coate, gowne or
the like hunge vpp in the Shrowdes Alsoe it
is a Common signe of some extremitie when 
a shipp doth hange a waft vpon the Mayne 
staye anie blanckettes gowne or the like hanginge out
for a signe is called a waft which if it be hunge
vpon the Mayne staye is a signe that the shipp
hath sprunge a Leake or is in some distresse,/




the Wake;/
The wake of the shipp is the smoth water wch
the shipp doth make a Stearne her, showinge 
the waye that the shipp hath gone in the 
sea: By this wee give a Iudgement what waye
the shipp doth make: for if the wake be right
the Stearne, then we knowe she makes her
waye good as she lookes But if the wake
be apoynt two or more to Leeward, Then the
shipp goes to Leeward of her Course 
when a shipp doth staye a weather her 
wake: That is when shee doth not fall to 
Leeward it is a signe she feeles her helme
well and is a nimble shipp: In Chaseinge
they saye wee have gott her wake; that
is wee are gott as farr into the wynd as
shee, and soe goe right after her as she
goes




Wale;/
Vide Bend;





Wale reared;/
That is when ashipp is buylt right vp After
she comes to her beareinge: This is vnsightly
and as they terme it not shipp-shapen, But
it makes a shipp wthin board much more 
Roomyer and not the lesse wholsome shipp in
The Sea if her beareinge be well layd out;




Walt
A ship is said to be walt when she hath not
Ballast enough to keepe her stiffe to beare
a saile:/




Warpe
Is anie  Rope which is vsed to warpe
wth most Commonly is a Hawser:




to Warpe;
Is to have a Hawser or anie other Rope 
sufficient to Hale vpp the shipp, and an Anchor
bent to it and soe they laye that out over the
Barr, over which wee are to goe, and soe by that
to hale the shipp foreward It is vsed when
wee want a wynd to carry vs out or into
a Harbor, and this is called warpinge;/




to Wash a ship
That is vsed at Sea when wee cannot come
a ground to Carrene her, Then wee make
her heeld over with the Ordinance, and men
vpon the yard Armes to a side, and soe 
wash that side and scrape it soe much as it
is out of the water which is Commonly some
Five or Sixe strookes: This is done in 
Calmes or in a Smooth roade;/






Wash of the shoare;/
That is Close by the Shoare;/




Wast
Is that part of the Ship which is betweene the
Maine-mast and the fore-castle.


Word-entry absent from British Library Sloane MS 207 but found in British Library Additional MS 21571, fol. 148r.





Wast boardes;/
Are the Boards which are sett vpp in the wast
of a shipp betwixt the Gunnwall & the MastÂ­
trees: but they are most vsed for boates to
be sett vp a longst the sides, to keepe the sea
from breakinge into them;/




Wast Clothes;
By a generall tearme all the Clothes wch
are Round a bout the Cage worke of the Hull
of the shipp are called wastclothes and are
the same that wee call the feight of the
shipp;/




Watch;/
At the sea the ships Company is divided
into two partes, the one called the Starbord
watch, the other the Larbord watch, The
Master is the Cheife of the Starbord and
his right hand Mates of the Larbord: these
are in their turnes to watch, Tryme sailes
Pumpe, and doe all duties for Fower
howers, and then the other watch is to 
releive them, Fower howers they call 
a whole watch: In Harbor and Roades
they watch but Quarter watch; that
is when one quarter of the Company
doe watch at a tyme;/




Water borne;
That is when a ship is iust even off 
the ground, that she floates: Then she is 
water borne;/






the water-lyne
Is that tyme which the Ship wrightes doe pretend
should be the depth which the shipp should swyme
in when she is laden both a head and Starne
for you must knowe a shipp never drawes soe
much a head as she doth a Starne, for if she
should, she would never Steere well;/




Water shott
Is a kinde of Mooreinge, that is to laye the Anchors
not Crosse the tyde, nor right vp and downe 
the tyde, but as you would saye betwixt both 
That is quarteringe;/




the Water waye
The smale peece of lead or Tymber wch
has fore and Aft on all the ships deckes close
by the sides, which is to keepe the water from 
runninge downe there is Called the waterÂ­
waye




Waueinge;/
Is makinge a signe for a shipp or a Boate 
to come towardes them, or else to goe from them
as the signe is made, either towardes or fromwardes
the shipp;/




Way of a ship
The Rake and runne of a shipp is called her
waye forward on, or aftward on; Alsoe when she
sayles a place they will saye the ship hath good 
waye, fresh waye or the like: likewise in castinge
the dead recnynge, they allowe her Leeward waye;
That is soe much as she drives to Leeward



from that she seems to goe;/




to Weather;/
That is to goe to wyndward of a place or 
shipp: Somtymes wee are embayed soe that
wee cannot weather a headland to gett cleere
and then we must doe our best to turne in and
out till wee can have a faire wynd to Clawe
it off;/




Weather-bowe
That is the Bowe next weather and soe of
all partes of the ship or anie thinge that is to 
the wyndward most side wee saye it is the weather
parte or the weather &c.;/




to Weather
Coyle;/
Is when a shipp is a Hull to laye her head 
the other waye, wthout looseinge anie sayle wch
is only donne by beareinge vpp the Helme, It
is an excellent Condicion in a shipp; for 
most shipps will not weather coyle: the vse
of it is: that when wee desire, to drive with her
head the other way a Hull, then wee neede not
open anie sayle, wherewth before the shipp can
come neere she will runne a greate waye 
to Leeward when once she is before the 
wynde and sea vnder saile;/




Wedges;/
Wee vse to make fast the Mast in the 
Partners with wedges, and alsoe to putt
A wedge into the heeles of the Top Mast, to



beare vpp the Top mast vpon the Tressell
trees;/




the Whelps;/
Are the Brackettes sett to the body of the
Capstaine close vnder the Barres downe
to the decke, and are they which give the sweepe
to the Capstayne: These are made soe in 
partes that the Cabell may not bee apt to surge,
as it would if it did Runn vpon a whole round
body:/




the Whip;/
Is that staffe which the Steeres man doth holde in
his hand whereby it governes the Helme and
doth port it soe from one side to an other: It
hath a Ringe att one end which is putt over the
end of the Helme, and soe comes through the
Rowle vp into the Steeridge: In greateÂ­
ships they are not vsed for by reason of the
weight of the Rudder and the water which lyes
vpon it a fowle weather, they are not able
to governe the Helme with a whipp because 
conveniently there can stand but one Man
att the shipp;/




Whoodding;/
The Planckes which wch are ioyned and fastened
a gainst the shipp sides into the Stem are called
the whooddinges;/




wynde;/
To wynde a shipp is to bringe her head aboute
either with the boate or some oares out of her 
Hawse, or Sterne post, if she be a smale ship:
The shipp wyndes vpp, That is when she comes



to ryde by her Anchore, when they are vnder sayle
they vse to aske, how wyndes the shipp: that is 
vpon what poynt the Compasse doth lye with her
head;/




Wyndinge tackl;
The wyndinge Tackle is thus fitted A great
double bocke with three sheevers in it, which is fast
seased to the end of a smale Cabell which is brought
about the head of the Mast, and soe serves for
a Pendant this hath a Guye brought to it, from
the fore mat to the Blocke there is reeved
a Hawser, which is alsoe reeved through an other
double bocke haveinge a Strapp att thee end of it
wch strapp beinge putt through the eye of the 
slinges is locked into it with a Fidd and soe hoises
the goodes: the fall is reeved into the Snatch blocke
and soe brought to the Cap stayne whereby 
they heave in the goodes;/




a Wyndlasse;/
Is a peece of tymber haveinge some sixe or 
eight squares, and is placed from one side of 
the shipp to the other close abast the Stem 
aloft where the Cabells come in ; These are 
neuer vsed in our greate shipps: But the 
Fleminges doe vse them in good ships: The reason
is for that they goe very slightly Mand: And 
the wyndlas doth purchase much moore then 
a Cap stayne, and noe danger to the Men: For
the wyndlasse they heave about with hand speakes
putt into holes made at either end And though
they cannot heave foreward, or one should faile
the windlasse will Paule it selfe: But att
the Capstayne if anie faile: It may be the 
rest wilbe throwne from the Capstayne, and
their braynes beates out a gainst the shipp



sides, if they way in a Sea gate: But the
Chap stayne doth purchase faster by much
And therefore, wee haveinge men enough
To Man it doe vse that; They have a wyndlasse
Alsoe in the head of the Boate to wey the 
Anchor by the Buoy Rope;/




Wynd-taught
Anie thinge which holdes wynd a loft, which 
may preiudice the shipps sayleinge or ryding 
is said to be wynd taught, as too much 
rigginge, high Poopes and the like, Alsoe
when wee ride in anie greate stresse wee
bringe our yardes alongst shipps strike downe
our Top Mastes and the like because they 
hold wynd taught, is as much as stiffe, in
the sence of sea langwage, as sett taught
the Shrowdes: That is sett them stiffe;/




Wood & wood,
That is when two tymbers are lett into 
each other soe close that the wood of the one
doth ioyne close to the other;/




a Worme;/
Is an Iron on the end of a Staffe whereÂ­
wth wee drawe out the shott of a Peece if 
there be anie occasion;/





Worminge;/
Is the layinge of a smale Rope or lyne a longst
the shrowdes of a Cabell or hawser: the vse 
whereof is to helpe to strengthen the Cabell
or Rope to which it is vsed: The Flemminges
vse this to newe Ropes, others to old Ropes 
that are allmost decayed;/




Would or woulding
Is to bynd Ropes a bout anie Mastes, yard or
the like, to keepe on a fish, or somewhat to
strenghten it: Sometymes when the whoodÂ­
inges give waye, by the overcharginge of 
the Bolt spritt, they are fayne to would
to the Bowes, which they doe by passeinge a Cabell
through both sides, and soe bringing it in a gaine
and with hand speekes to twist it to geather
as stronge as may be, we neuer fish anie
mast, or yard but wee would it alsoe, And 
that is called the wouldinge of the Mastes
or yardes: Alsoe those Ropes which come 
from the Beakhead, over the Boltspritt
and lash it fast downe, from ryseinge att
the Pillowe, are called the wouldinges of 
the Bolt-spritt;/






Y

yard;/
As the length of the Mastes are proportioned
by the breadth of the Beame, soe contraryÂ­
wise the length of the yard is proportioned
by the length of her Keele: The proporcion
of this is not absolute: For he whoe will have
a Taunt Mat may have the narrower 
yardes and soe contrary, But the best and
most absolute that is agreed on is this: The
Mayne-yard of the ship is to be 5/6 partes of the 
Length of her Keele, The Topsayle yard to be
3/7 of the Mayne yard, and the Mayne yard for
bignesse is to be 3/4 of an inch for a yard in 
length, the length of the fore yard is to be 4/5
of the Mayne yard: The Crosse iacke yard, and
Spritt-saile yard is to be all of a length: But
allowe the Myssen yardes and Spritt sayles
yardes 1/2 an inch thicknesse to a yard in length
Topp the yard That is make them hange
even: the Clewe lynes doe properly topp
the Mayne and fore yardes: but when the
topp sailes are Stowed Then the topp saile
Sheates will topp them: Brase the yard: That
is travers aft that yard Arme whose Brase
is Haled, And by the Brases wee square the
yardes: That is make them hange right a Crosse,
and one yard arme, not Traversed more then 
an other. If the shrowdes be sett to forward they
will hinder the Traversinge of the yard: Trauersinge
the yard is to brase aft the yard;/




a yawe;
When the shipp is not steered Steddy but 
she goes in and out with her head, they say she
yawes: This doth much hinder a shipps waye
and therefore when a Man of warr is in Chase
he doth putt such to the Helme whoe can keepe



her steddyest, and evenest vpon a poynt; wch
is done only by care and iudgment to meete 
her with the helme before the head fall of or
else come to;/




a Yoake;/ 
When the sea is soe rought that men cannot
governe the Helme with their handes; Then 
they sease two blockes to the Helme on each
side att the e and Reevinge two falls through
them like Gunners tackles bringe them to
the shipps sides, and soe hange some att one 
Tackle, and some at an other, they gouerne
the Helme as they are directed There is
alsoe an other waye of takeinge a double 
turne aboute the End of the Helme with 
a single Rope, The e beinge belayd fast to the
shipp sides By this they maye guide the Helme
but not with soe much ease as the other waye
now ether of these is Called a yoake to 
Steere by
