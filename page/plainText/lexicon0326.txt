SECVNDA EPISTOLA
LECTORI.



The Second Epistle to the Reader.




IN the search of Tongues (in which these many yeares I haue)
spent my time and substance) I haue alwayes found that the
true knowledge and the sure holding of them in our memories,
consisted, in the knowing of them, by their Causes, Originalls,
and Etymologies, that is, their reasons and deriuations, which
is the scope I ayme at in this my Worke Etymologicall, deriued from
the Greeke Ετυμόϛ true, and λόγοϛ speach, as Orthographie is said of
όρθόϛ right, and γϱαϕή writing. In my Latine Epistle to the Reader I
haue alleaged sundry Authors, of high learning, both ancient and
moderne, which haue written whole books of this Subiect, and a great number more
could I here produce, out of all I haue gathered, as much as I could in manie yeeres
search, and haue as well as I could, applied it to my Countreyes vse; by laying the lan­
guages so together that are of one sound, (which I may terme a harmony of Tongues)
for that thou mayest with little or no labour, well learne, and fast hold in thy memorie, these
languages so layd together: wherefore, for thy better vnderstanding, I giue thee this
further instruction, as an Introduction to the same, and say, that many languages dif­
fer one from another, but by these figures, * Próthesis, Aphæresis, Epénthesis, Syncope,
Paragóge, Apócope, Met´thesis, &c. which I expound in English thus; Prothesis, a put­
ting to of a letter or syllable, to the beginning of a word;  Aphæresis, a taking away of a letter or
syllable from the beginning of a word;  Epenthesis, a putting betweene of a letter or syllable, in 
the middle of a word; Syncope, a taking away, or cutting of a letter or syllable from the middle
of a word;  Paragoge, a putting to a letter or syllable to the end of a word; Apócope, the taking
away, or cutting of a letter or syllable, from the end of a word; Metáthesis, a transposition when
one letter is put for another or in anothers place. All which figures, you may see better expoun­
ded from the Greeke, in this Dictionarie in their proper place, which figures vsed thorow
the whole course of this worke, almost in euery word, you may well finde, before you come
to the Etymologie of the words, all which being so helpefull to true vnderstanding and
memorie, that it might be a sufficient motiue, to men that haue meanes, and desire knowledge, to
giue themselues to the vnderstanding of the Tongues from their Originals, the Keyes
to vnlocke the Doores, into the Treasurie of all Learning, Diuine and humane: For if
we doe but looke in the Etymologies but of the very names of men in the holy Scripture,
we shall see, what light they giue, euen to the vnderstanding of the story, and do but marke
the Hebrew wordes beginning in * Ab, to signifie a father,  Ben, a sonne or Building,
* Beer a well, or wildernesse, * Beth a house, and multitudes of others, in other sylla­
bles, of other significations, thorow the whole course of the Bible, deriued not onely
from the Hebrew, Chaldie, and Syriack, but also from the Greeke, and Latine, and so to 
consider the middle and end of words, what they signifie by Etymologizing and deri­



uing them aright, you shall see what vnderstanding they bring into stories: as for example,
the *Patriarke Abram, which is by interpretation, a high father, deriued from the Hebrew 
 Ab pater, a father, and  ram excelsus, high; but when his name was changed into Abra­
ham, Gen. 17. 5. where it is said, neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but they name
shall be Abraham, for a father of many nations haue I made thee, Gen. 17. 5. and Rom. 4. 17. the
word  Abraham in the Hebrew, importeth the same, being recompounded of  A­
bram, pater excelsus, a high father (as aboue) and  ham, multitudo, a multitude, so the
words in Hebrew Abram-Ham, signifie a high father of multitudes, and by the fi­
gure Syncope, taking away  m from the middle, is made  Abraham; so *  
Iaakob his name was called, because in his birth he did  Iaakob, that is, hold his brother E­
sau by the  gnekeb, that is, the heele, Gen. chap. 25. vers. 26. but Esau his brother, after he
was deceiued by him of the blessing, interpreteth his name  Iagnakob, Iaakob, of  
gnakab, supplantauit, he hath supplanted or tripped vp  gnekeb, the heele, Gen. 27. 36. but
when Iaakob had wrestled with the Angel, and would not let him goe, till he was blessed by him,
Gen. 32. 26, 27. be said, Thy name shall be called Iaakob no more, but *Israel, because thou hast
power with God, Gen. 32, 28. which commeth of the Hebrew  Ish vir, a man, and  sharah,
præualuit, he hath preuailed with  El, God of  eial, fortitudo: looke in the word God, in
this Dictionarie, there may you see the Tenne names of God in the Hebrew, * Ben­
iamin, is interpreted, the sonne of the right hand, of the Hebrew  Ben, a sonne, and 
iamin the right hand, for his father Iaakob loued him dearly, Gen. 44. vers. 22. & 29. & 30.
he was called by Rachel his mother * Ben-oni, the sonne of sorrow, for that he died in trauell with
him, Gen. 35. 18. of the Hebrew  Ben, a sonne, and  oni, sorrow, so *  Beer, a well,
Num. 21. 16. and Beersheba, the well of the oath, of the Hebrew  Beer, a well, and 
Schabang, iurauit, he sware, as it is written, wherefore he called that place Beersheba, because
there they sware both of them, Gen. 21. 31. of this word Beer,  may well come the Low-dutch
and English, Boorne, a place full of pits and welles of water, and of them, the names of Townes,
as Lamboorne, Aboorne, and many other scituated on such Boornes. So *Beth, a house, and
Bethel, the house of God, the place where Iaakob slept, and dreamed he saw a ladder, that
the toppe thereof reached vnto heauen, then Iaakob awoke, and said, Surely the Lord is
in this place, this is none other but the house of God, and called the name of the place Bethel,
Gen. 28. verse 16. 17. 18. 19. of the Hebrew  baijth, a house, and  gneden, de­
liciæ, pleasure, of  gnadan, delectari, to delight, and many more in Beth in the Bible, signify­
ing a house: *  Daniel, the iudgement of God, of  Dan, iudgement, and  El, God; *Su­
sanna, a lillie, of the Hebrew  Shushan, a lillie, which betokeneth chastitie and good fame,
*Vriel, light or fire of God, of the Hebrew  vr, ignis, fire, and  El, God, *Vrim and
*Thummim, light and perfection, of the Hebrew  vr, ignis, fire, and in the plurall,  Vrim, 
fires, as the plurall  Thummim, perfectiones, of the singular  Tom, perfectio, of the
verbe  Tamam, perfecit: This Vrim and Thummim, light and perfection, God com­
manded to be put in the brest-plate of Iudgement (one of the holy garments appoin­
ted for Aaron, to weare vpon his heart when he went in before the Lord) Exod. 28. 30. 
Ezra 2. 63. and Deut: 33. 8. by Vrim is meant knowledge, and Thummim holinesse, shewing
what vertues are required in Priests: Such like the Bible doth affoord plentifull examples
to any that are studious to know * the true significations of the Hebrew words from their rootes;
which in those that make profession of Diuinitie, or desire true knowledge therein, it is
most requirable, necessary, and most helpefull to true vnderstanding and memorie.

The Greeke likewise doth abound with multitudes of Etymologies, hauing so many 
compounded and recompounded words, whereby we may easily, if we will but looke out the
Originall, carrie well in mind diuers words that depend thereon, although I instance in the word
night, yet it shall giue some light άβρὸτη the night, deriued of α priuatiue, which signifieth
without, and βροτὸ mortalis, as you would say, the time without mortall men stirring abroad,
of this word άβρὸτη the night, ariseth ἁβροτάζζω to erre, to goe out of the way as in the night,
and ἁβροτήμων Peccator, a sinner, and ἁβροτίνη Peccatum, sinne, also of βροτὸ  mortalis com­
meth ἂμβροτοσ immortalis, quasi ἁβροτὶς of a priuatiue, which is not, and βροτὸ mortalis also
ἁμβροσια Ambrosia, immortall foode, the foode of Gods, as Nectar their drinke, the let­
ter μ put in by the figure Epenthesis, for sound sake, of such Greeke words, and multitude
of others, with all the other languages; I referre you, if you like it, to looke into this volumne
for this purpose published, werein also sometimes are proper names set downe, in order of Al­
phabet with the rest, rather to giue notice to those that are ignorant, that Etymologies haue



the same force with them as in other ordinary words, all which proper names if I could
here set downe with their Etymologies, would not bee contained in such another Vo­
lume; *The Greeke and his Etymologies, doe to all, that but in a little measure know that Tongue,
plainely proue it selfe most helpefull to vnderstanding and memories of Philosophers, Physicions,
Mathematicians, Orators, Poets, and all louers of humane learning. I had an intent to
haue added so many Tables at the end of this Booke; *one I haue done, the Spanish, and
that most copious, with diuers thousands of words added to my former Spanish Dicti­
onary, besides I haue interpreted this Spanish Dictionary with the Latine and English, and
sometimes French and Italian, and also of all, or the most part of Spanish words therein, I
haue giuen there their Etymologies, or referred them by figures in this Volume, where you
may finde them, and the reasons of them, with the other tenne Languages. For the rest of 
Tables I say, seeing there are so many excellent copious Dictionaries in Hebrew, Greeke,
Latine, Italian, French and other Languages, I referre you to them as you have vse
of them. 

*If you desire further to haue the Etymologies of words, or the consent of diuers Lan­
guages, here in this Volume so set downe (as heretofore neuer yet published) you
may your selfe as you take delight in a Language, or some for you take paines with penne to set
downe, and reduce any Language herein contained, to an Alphabet, or Table, for your owne
priuate vse, or for others, (as I haue done in the Spanish for the publike) and it may
be it will then best please you when you doe it to your owne minde and methode, and by that
meanes to draw out an abstract as in other studies men vse to doe.

*Touching the obiecting of the Translating Calepine, Megiserus, Decimator, &c. I may
answere if I had so done, and turned it to my Countreys vse, I had done a laborious worke, but
it is farre otherwise, for they giue the Etymologies but onely of the Latine, and sometime of the 
Greeke, but I performe it in all the eleuen, as also lay the Languages which are of one sound (for
memories sake) together, which none of them, nor others yet euer haue done. And whereas, some
conceit as themselues haue told me, led by the opinion of some learned, That if I had placed the
Latine first, it would haue had more grace and liking. I say againe as a little aboue, that any one
himselfe, or others for him, may reduce all the Latine words, or other Language in this Di­
ctionarie, to an Alphabet or Table, with ioyning what Language together he likes, and so
best please himselfe, when hee doth it, to his owne method and minde.

*My purpose in placing the English first, before other Tongues, is for the vse chiefly of
our owne Nation, or others that vnderstand the English Tongue, to finde out any Word by
order of Alphabet they call or looke for, and so by that to haue a fit French, Italian, Spa­
nish word, to speake or write, (in which Calepine is very faultie) beside to haue the Etymo­
logies of them as of all the rest, (the better euer to hold them in their memorie) which
none other yet euer hath performed.

*The Law-Termes likewise of this land, with the descriptions of Offices, Officers and Ma­
gistrates, and Titles of dignities, are by order of Alphabet at large in this volume set downe,
with this marke ą, which may giue delightfull reading to the Master, and Clerkes of any office,
or others that seeke to vnderstand the reason or knowledge of them.

*What vse Merchants may make of this Booke, especially those that are in person to traficke
in forreine Countreys and Tongues, I need not here set downe, when it approoues it selfe so
plaine to euery mans vnderstanding, that will vse the same, that by the English Alphabet they
may finde any of these Languages to speake or to write, and the Etymologies for memorie of 
them. And seeing I haue made so dangerous a voyage, and aduenture, in so many tempests in an
Ocean of trauailes, troubles, and hard sufferings, and wants, the greater part of this twenty
yeeres, to bring this tossed Barke vnwreckt, which here vnlades, and layes in order to your viewes
the Commodities that are in the same. I shall be right glad and comforted that Merchants (that
for aduentures sake merite money) might make great vse with pleasure of my paynes (being such an
aduenturer as I am) and much the rather for that in my yonger time, aboue thrity yeeres since,
by meanes of some worthy Merchants (which here and elsewhere with due respect and thanke­
fulnesse I euer shall acknowledge.) I was first furnished according to my then great desires, to tra­
uell into forreine Countreys, and get the knowledge of some of the Tongues (which I haue
professed) and at their seruices here present, and truely affirme, that not onely my furnishing
forth, my supplie when I wanted abroad, and my transporting from one Countrey to another, as also
my last comming home (when I had beene taken prisoner) was still by Merchants. Thus
much I thought in generall termes as a Testimonie of the due thankefulnesse, and my euer respect
I owe towards them therefore: The particulars I omit for other places and times.



*And at this time, to publish to the world, of the helpes that of late I haue had in English,
of Honorable, and other worthy persons, some by gifts, others by lending great summes to lift vp
this worke to the eye of the World for the generall good, lying languishing for want of Printing,
which now being done so much by their good meanes, I doe here to the world first professe
my hearty thankefulnesse to the Almighty God, that hath of his goodnesse thus farre enabled
my weake bodie and meanes, in so great a worke, and next; due remembrance vnto men, that by
their meanes, it is thus published in Print: And if the Bookes now Printed, may be at a reasona­
ble rate sould and vented, I may be incouraged, and others who are ingaged about this Worke, in
great summes, may be the sooner satisfied and payed. And if any bee profited or pleasured here­
by, if they will next vnder GOD, acknowledge with me thankefulnesse vnto those, that haue been
great meanes to bring it to this passe, I shall bee the more comforted, that they doe Sympathize
with mee, in my true affection, and due respect towards them therefore.

And whereas I may incurre offence, or suspicion of flattery, to set downe the names of some
worthy persons in this Kingdome, who haue much fauoured and furthered this Worke,
and without whom I could finde no other meanes at that time, to bring it to this passe: For that
their worths are such, that euery day as occasion is offered (being in great places) they may,
and doe performe greater matters in the Common-wealth: For these and some other
respects, I doe forbeare the here naming of them.

And whereas some sixe yeeres since, when I had done this Volume Etymologicall of eleuen
Languages as copious as I could for the Presse, being then in Oxford, and hauing my Co­
pie, and company of certaine Strangers and Schollers at mine owne charge about the
Worke there, I made suit vnto the Uniuersitie to haue the Testimony of my paines, and ex­
pence, and their approbation of this Worke, which vnder the Seale of the Vniuersitie, with the
hands of the Right Worshipfull Mr. Vicechancellour, and the rest of the heads of houses
there, they then freely gaue mee (to my first comfort, after my so long and chargeable labours
herein:) And for that then I found, I had spent all my substance thereupon, and got­
ten greatly into debt thereby, I laboured for His Maiesties Letters Patents, which by
the meanes of certaine Right honourable Personages, by shewing some part of the Worke,
I obtained his Maiesties gracious Graunt herein. For which, and other furtherances for set­
ting this Worke forward, I remaine to their Honours much obliged and bound: which
Letters Patents, with my Copie, I tendred to the Company of Stationers to be sould,
who by reason of my great debts to be paid thereby, refused the same. Whereby I was for­
ced to proiect how I might get it Printed, and thought, if it might be hearkened vnto, 
that Multorum manibus grande leuetur opus. I first preferred Petition to the Honourable
and Right Worshipfull Benchers and Gentlemen, of the honourable Societies of Graies Inne, and
Lincolnes Inne, by whose goodnesse and Contributions it was first set on Printing: After
them followed diuers Honorable and Right Worshipfull Personages, Bishops and others, which
I forbeare to name, for former respects, and returne to the first setters in Print of this
Worke, the honourable Societies of the Innes of Court, with my proceedings by Petition to
the honourable Societie of the Inner Temple, with like successe, and here likewise publish my
due respect and thankefulnesse to them, for furthering this worke, as the former Innes of
Court before had done. And whereas before I came to that Inne of Court, and since it
hath beene said to me, that I should neuer be able to raise such summes to the Printing of
so great a Worke, but that which they then did, they thought well of in respect of my en­
deauours, and therefore did the lesse, because they had no hope, that euer it should be brought
to passe (as a thing indeede in these times very hard for that Huad facilè emergunt quorum
virtutibus obstat res angusta domi) yet now by Gods blessing, and their goodnesse to set
it first on, I haue by that meanes wrought my selfe in credite againe to borrow great summes
thereupon, to make an end thereof, to present it to your viewes as you see, (though it hath cost
me the hazard of my life therefore.) And I doe here protest, that I neuer had intent to trou­
ble any man with Contribution, if the Worke and my selfe had not beene in these despe­
rate termes; wherefore as soone as I could, I freed the Worke and my selfe from that im­
putation, and little respect (of a thing neuer so good in such needie courses. Yet if a man
duely consider, or rather be driuen to prooue, they shall finde, that Necessitie makes
men Artists, that neuer meant to be skilled, and Cowards to fight, that durst not otherwise draw
weapon, and if honour or profite be also proposed, greater spurres cannot be set to a man that hath
spirit euen to performe actions that are seeming beyond his power. 

I had a minde to haue made suit in like manner to the Middle-Temple, as to the other
Innes of Court, but as soone as I could get credite, to borrow money to accomplish the



Worke, I did forbeare them, and all others in that kinde; yet one I must acknowledge of that
house, whose purse hath payd to the setting forward of this, as of diuers other good workes (if
I be silent, dayly his good deeds doe speake the same) who wel knowes a great part of my expense,
and paines hereabouts, and also at diuers times, like an honourable Gentleman hath done me
about this Worke, sundry former fauours.

And that you may now see I meant not to prosecute these courses of Contribution,
when that I could borrow elsewhere, I will here set downe that a Gentleman of worth
and vnderstanding, Sir Iohn Lawrence Knight, (who not only was one of the first and most
bountifullest Benefactors to raise this Worke vp, but also seeing it sticke for want of summes to set
it forward, lending and laying downe further out of his purse, a great summe, and ioy­
ning with the Right Worshipfull Mr. Doctor Aileworth of Great Milton, Mr. Paul
Peart; and Mr. Henry Brigges, they did at their charge, Print off the rest, and greatest
part of the maine Booke of eleuen Languages here done; and a Right Worshipfull
and most learned Gentleman, Sir Henry Spelman Knight, and a worthy Citizen Master
Richard Booth, and againe the aboue-named Mr. Henry Brigges; (all which had for­
merly likewise furthered the first worke) did lend and lay downe so much money more, to the
Compiling and Printing of this new Spanish Dictionary, in Spanish, Latine and English, and
sometimes other Languages, with some certaine thousands of words, and their Etymologies,
added to my former Spanish Dictionarie, to these Gentlemen, for their helpes and mo­
neys, I do here publish my thankfulnes to them therefore, and vnto one Mr. Robert Tres­
well Esquire, Surueyor of His Maiesties Woods, and Mr. William Caldwell Esquire, both which in
the former, and later, haue engaged themselues in good summes for the sooner and
better bringing them to passe. I do likewise heere acknowledge the name, and conti­
nued good turnes and fauors to set this Worke forward, of Mr. Thomas Warricke Esquire,
and Mr. Iohn Porie, a little before he went to trauell out of England. And whereas I
made an end of the Dictionary Etymologicall of eleuen Languages in Oxford, and began
and made an end of the Spanish in Cambridge; and much the sooner by the fauourable
goodnesse of the Right Worshipfull Vicechancellours and the rest of the heads of
houses of both Vniuersities, to animate some Schollers to set to their helping hands,
for which their forwardnesse to set foorth this Worke, I doe heere publish my hum­
ble thankefulnesse to them all, and especially to some of them, to whom I remaine more
particularly bound, whose names I here forbeare, for priuate respects. And I doe
heartily wish, that all those that are pleasured hereby, might acknowledge with mee thanke­
fulnesse to those, by whose good meanes it is thus brought to passe, and would likewise
wish (thought not likely to obtaine) Readers, without gaule or bitternesse, ready to excuse,
slow to condemne, full of charitable spirit, voide of their owne vaines and opinions:
and I doe promise what faults I haue herein committed, being thereof admonished,
I will doe my best to make amends, for as yet I cannot winne out time, to reade ouer the
Worke, to finde out the Errata: And as for the contenting of some conceited, that
make sleight account of making of a Dictionary, I striue not, but appeale to those that haue
laboured in this kind, who best by their owne triall, can iudge hereof; and for others
I esteeme not their accompt, till they haue made like triall, yet doe in all
things submit my selfe, and doings, to the censure of the wiser sort, dis­
creete and learned. If this Epistle or the former seeme to thee
too tedious, vnderstand that I meant not to set a little Gate
to so great a Building, and so I leaue this Worke,
and my selfe, hard to please few, harder to
please many, impossible to
please all.
