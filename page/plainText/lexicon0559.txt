The pow'r and Rule of Speaking resteth still.

TO THE READER.


THE several Climates of the World, have influenced the
Inhabitants with Natures very different from one ano­
ther. And their several speeches bear some proportion 
of Analogy with their Natures. The Spanish and the Spaniard 
both are Grave, the Italian and th' Italians Amourous, the
Dutch as boisterous as the Germans, and the French as light 
as they themselves are. But the moderate Clime of England has 
indifferently temper'd us as to both: and what excess there is in 
either, must be attributed to the accession of something Foreign. 
Our changes are all professedly owing to the Conquests, especially 
of Sax and Normandy.

The first was far the greater, and by virtue of That the body of 
our Language is still Teutonick: But the Last is that which
more nearly concerneth us; because, though its first irruption
was not a violent Inundation, yet it forced us to such a
Communication with
France, that our Genius is wrought into some
resemblance of theirs: and
(to imitate them) we bring home fashions, terms and phrases from
every Nation and Language under
Heaven. Thus we should fill one
another with Confusion and Barbarity,
were it not for some such faithful Interpreter as is here
presented to the Prince of
Isles.

Not that I am ignorant of what's already done. I know the
whole Succession from Dr. Bulloker, to Dr.
Skinner, from the smallest volume to the largest
Folio. I know their difference and their Defects. Some are too
little, some are too big; some are too plain (stufft with
obscenity not to be named) and some so obscure, that (instead
of expounding others) they have need themselves of an
Expositor. The method of some is foolish, and supposes things
to be known before they are explained. For



when the Terms of Art are reduced to their several Heads, you
must know (in general) what your word is, before you can possi­
bly tell where to seek it; or else (as they say) you must look a 
needle in a bottle of Hay.

Suppose you want the meaning of Belperopis or Dulcarnon, 
they are not in the Common herd; where will you look them? 
In the Law-terms? they are not there. Sure then they are proper 
Names; But they are not there neither. What's to be done? 
Why, look till you find and you will not lose your
labour.

Some that pretend to correction and exactness, transcribe out
of others (hand over head) their very faults and all.

Hear how severely Doctor Skinner taxes one of them, --- Solens 
hallucinatur: and again, --- Ridicule ut solet omnia: and in ano­
ther place, --- ubi notare est miserrimam Authoris igno­
rantiam, &c.

But that Man had but a little work, and so was bound to have
done it well. It is excusable in a World of Words to say that 

Contemptible and Contemptuous, Ingenious and Ingenuous are 
all one:  that Decomposit signifies Compounded of two other 
words: Emberweek is the week next before Lent: Froise, a pancake 
or tansie:  Gallon, a measure of two quarts:  Gomer, nine gal­
lons (instead of one.)  Limbus Patrum, where the Saints reside 
till the Resurrection:  Nazareth, the place where Christ was
born,  Redstert, a Robin Red-breast, &c.


And a thousand more such, which simple Children would be apt
to contradict, but Men of Judgement (for whom they were 
not writ) know where the mistake might lie. Yet sure 't 
would have made his worship smile, to have readd, how that 
Argus King of P. for his singular wisdom and circumspection,
was feigned by the Poets to have had no eyes.


Custode admittendo, a writ for the removing of a
Guardian.

Ejaculation, a yelling.

Eviration, a yielding.

Fidicula, a falling vulture.

Ichidian, the Motto of the Princes Arms.

Iopaena, a song of rejoicing.

Lungis, a tall slim man that has no length to his height.

Mayweed, like Cammomile in smell, but of a stinking
savour, &c.




So many there are of this Nature and so gross, that (let the
reason be what it will) they are altogether intolerable.

In that which I have done, I do not warrant absolute perfection. 
The pains that are taken in it, will appear at first sight. The ad­
dition that is made to the number of words in former Authors of 
this kind, is almost incredible (considering the bulk) being raised 
from seven in th' Expositor to almost thirty thousand here; which 
is some thousands more than are in Mr. Blunts Glossographia or
Mr. Philips World of Words. The order I observe is altogether Al­
phabetical; for that best answers the design of Informing others. 
If any would have the proper Names, Terms of Law, Navigati­
on (or any other Art) by themselves, they may go through the 
whole and (with delight and profit) reduce them all to their par­
ticular Heads.

I am no friend to vain and tedious repetitions. Therefore you
will often meet with words explain'd in their dependance and re­
lation to one another, and the sence compleated by taking them
together: as for example,


Lupa, a She-wolf that nourished Romulus in the
Lupercal, a place near Rome, where were celebrated the
Lupercalia, Feasts in honour of Pan, performed by the
Luperci, Priests of Pan---.


Poetical expressions may be allowed to Poetical Relations and
Fictions; yet here and there I give a hint, to let you know, that 
I take them not for real verities.

The history of the Bible I suppose to be so well known, as that 
I only give the plain English of the Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriack 
and Greek Names.

Here is a large addition of many words and phrases that be­
long to our English Dialects in the several Counties, and where 
the particular Shire is not exprest, the distinction (according to 
the use) is more general into North and South-Country words.

Here are also added all the Market-Towns (and other conside­
rable places) in England, with all the places of note in other
Countries, especially the Neighbour Nations. Where it is to 
be observed, that (as Dr. Heylin saies of Hungary) it were in­
finite labour to expresse every little place which the seat of a war



gives occasion for History to mention.

'Tis no disparagement to understand the Canting Terms. It 
may chance to save your throat from being cut, or (at least) your
Pocket from being pickt.

I have not only retain'd, but very much augmented the num­
ber of Old Words. For though Mr. Blount (as he saies express­
ly) shunn'd them, because they grew obsolete; yet doubtless 
their use is very great: not only for the unfolding those Authors 
that did use them, but also for giving a great deal of light to o­
ther words that are still in use. Those that I call Old Words are 
generally such as occurr in Chaucer, Gower, Pierce Ploughman 
and Julian Barns.

And whosoever has a mind, instead of them (or other vulgar
terms) to use expressions that are more polite; he sees what words 
are markt for Latin, Greek or French, and may himself make
such Collections as will be far more advantageous, than if they
had been gathered to his hand.

Finally, that I might be the more comprehensive (for here is
very much in very little room) I have signified the derivation of 
the words from their several Originals, and the Names of the Coun­
ties in which they are used, by one or two of their initial letters; 
the meaning of which is exprest in the following Table.
