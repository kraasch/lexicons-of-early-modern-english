Iesuits in their Latin translation of the English Te­
stament haue without need vsed, as it may
seeme for these causes:

First, to show their fine eloquence, and thereby to mooue their sim­
ple readers and hearers to admire them, who commonly
haue in admiration such strange things as
they do not vnderstand.

Secondly, to make the Scripture darke and hard to be vn­
derstood of the vnlearned people, and so to depriue
them of that profit and comfort
which they might re­
cieue by it.

And lastly, for that they would as much dissent,
and as little agree with vs, as
they might.

may say as S. Hierom sometime said. Rogo quæ sunt hæc
portenta Verborum? that is, I pray thée what monstrous
words be these? And as Demosthenes said, these be not ῤήματα
but θαύματα, not words but wonders. This is not to obey the

Nazianzen. de mo­
dest. seruanda in
disput.

wise counsell of Gregorie Nazianzene who saith: ἔχγ τω̃ν
συντζοφω̃ν ῤημάτων. that is, vse natiue and common words. Nor
to doo the office of a good interpretor, whose dutie is as S. Hi­

Hieron. ad Mar­
cellam, tom. 4

erom saith, Non quo ipse disertus appareat, &c. Not that he
should séeme to be eloquent himselfe, but to make him that
readeth it, so to vnderstand it, as he that write it.
