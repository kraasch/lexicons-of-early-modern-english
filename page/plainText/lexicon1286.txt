TO THE RIGHT 
HONOVRABLE AND 
Vertuous, his singular good 
Lady, the Lady JANE Vicoun­
tesse MOUNTAGUE, all ho­
nour and happinesse.

BEing perswaded (Right Noble 
Lady) by some friends, for pub­

like benefit to make this Colle­
ction of words common, which 
at first was intended onely for 
private use, (as written in my youth; at the re­
quest of a worthy Gentleman, one whose love
prevailed much with me) I could not finde in 
heart to send it forth, no better furnished than 
with a bare Title; lest like an unknown Infant, 
it would be exposed to over hard usage, or per­
adventure scornfully rejected, adventuring a­
broad without countenance of any friend or



commander. Vpon sure knowledge therefore 
of your most honourable disposition, and former 
experience of your Ladiships favour toward 
me, I am emboldened to present this little 
Pamphlet unto your Honour, with hope that 
by your Patronage it shall not onely be protect­
ed from injuries, but also finde favourable en­
tertainment, and perhaps gracefully admitted
among greatest Ladies and studious Gentlewo­
men, to whose reading (I am made beleeve) it 
will not prove altogether ungratefull. And al­
though I may well be taxed of folly or pre­
sumption, that for credit of a slender trifle, crave 
the assistance of so eminent a Person, yet such 
I confesse) is my care thereof (since I must not 
deny it for my own) and my dutie and devoti­
on so affected to your Honour, and all yours;
that I have, (hoping of your Ladyships pardon) 
wilfully repelled all reasons which might dis­
swade me, chusing herein not so much what 
may seem most seemly, as what I suppose most 
behovefull for me.

Accept therefore I beseech your Honour, 
and receive under your noble tuition this little 
Vocabulary Treatise, which having been many 
yeers restrained of libertie, is now glad of en­
largement, especially recommended unto so 
worthy a Patronesse. The glorious Sun loseth



not the least point of his heighth by liberall
lending down his light, and quickning with his 
influence the lowest creatures; neither is any 
eminency disgraced, that easily condescendeth
to others desired good: which is also confirmed
by the Poet, who saith;


Conspicitur nunquam meliore potentia causa,
Quam quoties vanas non sinit esse preces.


Not thinking needfull therefore to trouble 
your Honour with many words of entreatie
(upon assured confidence of your well known
Charitie and goodnesse) I conclude, sincerely
wishing to your Ladiship, the best that may be 
wished, and resting my self ever,


Your Honours to be 

commanded,

JO. BULLOKAR.






To the Courteous Reader.

HEre have you (Gentle Reader) that which 
at first was not made for you, though now 
willingly (for your benefit if you embrace 
it) offered to your kinde acceptance. Com­
mend it my self I will not, lest I should give 
occasion to some quick heads, to come upon 
with the verse, Autor opus laudat, &c. Yet this I will 
say (and say truely) that in my younger yeers it hath cost me 
some observation, reading, study, and charge; which you may
easily beleeve, considering the great store of strange words, our 
speech doth borrow, not only from the Latine, and Greeke, (and 
some from the ancient Hebrew) but also from forraine vulgar 
Languages round about us: beside sundry old words now 
growne out of use, and divers termes of art, proper to the learn­
ed in Logicke, Philosophy, Law, Physicke, Astronomie, &c. 
yea, and Divinitie it self, best known to the severall profes­
sors thereof. And herein I hope such learned will deeme no 
wrong offered to themselves or dishonour to Learning, in that 
I open the signification of such words; to the capacitie of the 
ignorant, whereby they may conceive and use them as well as 
those which have bestowed long study in the languages; for 
considering it is familiar among best writers to usurpe
strange words, (and sometime necessary by reason our speech
is not sufficiently furnished with apt termes to expresse all 
meanings) I suppose withall their desire is that they should 
also be understood; which I (knowing that bonum quò 
communius eo melius) have endeavoured by this Booke,



though not exquisitely, yet (I trust) in some reasonable 
measure to performe. It is easier (all know) to finde faults,
then to mend them, and easier to mend faults in anothers 
worke already written, then to write any new work free from 
all fault. If therefore any fault finder, or over curious Cri­
tick (for from the best learned I expect best usage) shall to 
shew his skill grow captious, and quarrell at my interpretati­
ons, I will desire him to forbeare bitternesse, and temper a 
while his choler, till having laid this worke aside, he travell
himself in the same or some other new argument; and then I
doubt not but he will either become more indifferent, or give
others occasion to bid him English the old Proverbe, Media
cura te ipsuim. But as for you (judiciall or courteous Reader) 
whose favour I desire, and whose counsell or friendly correcti­
on I will not refuse, if to you (I say) any thing herein shall
occurre, which seemeth by me omitted, mistaken, or not fully
satisfactory to your expectation, (for indeed there are almost
slipt away seven yeers since I had any leasure as much as to 
looke on it) I promise that upon warning  hereof given to me 
or the Printer, at a second Impression it shall be
amended or 
supplyed. Meanewhile use this as you finde it, and I perswade
my self your honesty will say it is worth the money you paid for 
it. So committing my self and Book to your favourable good
liking, I commit you to God. From my house at Chicester 
 in Sussex, this 17. day of October. 1616.


Your heartie well-wisher, 
Jo: Bullokar.






An Instruction to the Reader.

HAve care to search every word ac­
cording to the true Orthography 
thereof, as for Phœnix in the Letter
P. not in F. for Hypostaticall
in Hy: not in 
Hi. Remember also that every word mark­
ed with this mark * is an old word, onely
used of some ancient Writers, and now 
grown out of use. Lastly, if a word be of 
different significations, the one easie, the o­
ther more difficult, I onely speak of inter­
pretation of the hardest; as in the words
Ten, Girle, Garter, may appear.

fore, the other after Aries. 
The second called a Quar­
till, is the distance of three 
signes, as Aries beholdeth 
Cancer and Capricorne,  with 
a Quartill aspect, because

of six signes asunder; as 
Aries beholdeth Libra 
with this opposite aspect,

holdeth Cancer and Pisces

dam foretell of the univer­
sall floud which should 
shortly drowne the world, 
they therupon erected, two 
great pillars, engraving in  



them the principles of A­

whiter, which plant grow­
eth in Egypt, and some

This juice is somewhat 
like to oyle, but more 
clammie, and inclining to 
a certaine rednesse. It hath 
a strong smell, and is not 
pleasant in taste: Being 
put into a vessell of water,

Basiliske. Otherwise cal­
led a Cockatrise: the most 
venemous serpent that is. 
It breaketh stones and 
blasteth all plants with the 
breath thereof, burning e­
very thing that it goeth o­
ver; neither can any herbe 
growe neere the place 
where it lyeth. It is poy­
son to poyson, and driveth 
away all other serpents, 
with only hissing. If a man 
touch it but with a sticke, 
it will kill him, and if 
it see a man a farre off, it 
destroyeth him with his 
looks. This serpent is not 
above a foot long, of color 
between black & yellow, 
having red eyes, a very 
sharpe head, and a white  



spot thereon like a crown 
wherefore he is called by 
some in Latine Regulus, 
viz. a little king. It goeth 
not winding like other ser­
pents, but upright unto the 
middle, holding up the 
brest thereof. It breedeth 
onely in the hot burning 
sands of Africa: Of this 
Basiliske the Poet Lucane 
writeth thus. lib. 9. 

Sibilaque effundens cunct as terrentia pestes. 
Ante venena nocens, late sibi submovet omne 
Vulgus, & in vacua regnat Basiliscus arena. 
With deadly hiss the Basiliske, 
    all other plagues doth fright. 
And speedier kils then poisons can, 
    with his infectious sight. 
Hee'le have no neighbour dwell neer him, 
    he loves to live alone. 
And tyrantlike reignes by himself, 
    in cave of sandy stone.

great Commander under

nesse of sinews or other 
parts, and against the bi­
ting of venemous beasts. 

Beades of Saint Elline. Cer­
tain round roots brought 
out of Florida, which 
being dry are very hard, 
on the outside black, and 
inwardly white: of a sweet 
smel and good taste. They  



are of great vertue against 
griefs of the stomack, as al­
so of the kidnies or reines.   

Beame.  The maine horn 
of a Hart or Stag.  

Beatitude.  Blessednesse.  

Beaver.  In armour it sig­
nifieth that part of the hel­
met which may be lifted 
up, to take breath the more 
freely: It is also a beast of 
very hot nature, living 
much in the water. His 
two forefeet are like the 
feet of the beast called 
Gattus, (as Joannes de San­
cto Amando writeth:) but 
what this Gattus is, I doe 
not well understand, only 
I suppose it to be an Ottter. 
Vpon these feet he hath 
very sharp claws, where­
with he taketh his prey, 
and hangeth upon water 
banks. His hinder feet are 
made like to the foot of a 
Goose, wherewith hee 
swimeth. He hath very 
sharpe teeth, and doth 
much harme to trees, with 
knawing the roots and 
rynds of them. It is writ­
ten that if a Beaver come 
into a strange place, where 
he hath not been bred, 
the other Beavers will 
make him their slave, to 
provide them meat, and 
pull off all the haire from 
his backe that he may be 
known. The stones of 
this beast are sold in Apo­
thecaries shops, by the 
name of Castoreum: they 
are much used in Physick, 
being very good against 
palsies and cold diseases of 
the sinews: But the skin 
is of more valew then the 
stones.  

Beeglue.  That which 
Bees doe make at the en­
try of their Hive, to keep 
out cold.  

Beestings.  The first milke 
that commeth from the 
Teat, after the birth of any 
thing.  

Belial.  An Hebrew word 
signifying a wicked naugh­
tie person. An Apostata; 
one without yoke, and is 
many times taken for the 
devill.  

Belive.  By and by, a­
non.  

Bellona.  Warre, or the 
goddesse of Warre among 
the Heathen.  

Belt.  A girdle.  



Belzebub.  An Hebrew 
word compounded of Bel, 
which in that language 
signifieth an Idol, and 
Zebub, a Fly: so that Bel­
zebub  signifieth the Idoll 
of Flies: notwithstanding 
commonly it is taken for 
the devill.

ny other excellent proper­
ties to be used in Physicke. 
The tree upon which it 
groweth is not with us 
certainly known.  

Berill.  A precious stone 
brought out of India, cut 
most commonly with sixe 
corners, because otherwise 
it would not shew so faire, 
if the sticking out of the 
corners did not make the 
brightnesse more mani­
fest. It is of a greenish 
colour, like the water of 
the Sea.  

Bestiall.  Beastly: disho­
nest.  

Bestialitie.  Beastlinesse.  

Bevie.  A herd of row 
Bucks: most commonly 
with us it signifieth, a great 
number of Quails in com­
pany together.  

Bevie greace.  The fat of a 
Row Deere. 

Beza stone. A stone of 
excellent vertue against 
poyson, very costly and of 
great account in Physick. 
It is commonly of the 
bignesse of an Acorne or 
Chestnut, being compoun­
ded of certain thin scales, 
one upon another, like 
the scales of an Onion. It 
is easie to be scraped or 
cut, and if it continue 
long in water, it melteth. 
The middle part is some­
thing hollow, and full of  



powder of the same sub­
stance that the stone is of. 
And this is a marke to 
know whether the stone 
be fine and true: for the 
Indians doe counterfeit 
them sometimes and de­
ceive many. This stone 
is taken out of the bow­
els of a beast in India, 
much like a Hart, saving 
that his hornes are like 
a goates. The occasion 
of the growing of the 
stones (as some write) is 
thus. These Harts or wilde 
Goats (for they resem­
ble both) going to the 
dennes of Serpents in 
those countries, doe with 
their breathing compell 
them to come forth, and 
then eate them: after 
they goe whereas water 
is, and plunge themselves 
therein untill they perceive 
the furie of the venome 
be past, and till then they 
will not drinke a drop: 
being come forth of 
the water, they goe into 
the fields, where feed­
ing upon many healthfull 
hearbs (known to them 
by naturall instinct to be 
of vertue against poyson) 
they are perfectly freed 
from all danger; and by 
the mixture of these herbs 
with the Serpents eaten 
before, these Bezar stones 
are very strangely (as is 
said) ingendered within 
them: growing by little 
and little, as appeareth 
by the scales thereof one 
folded upon another.   

Bezill.  The broad part 
of a Ring, in which the 
stone or signet is set.  

Bice.  A fine blew colour 
used by painters.

yeere hath one day more 
than other yeeres have. 
This leape yeere is obser­
ved every fourth yeere, and 
was first devised by Julius 
Caesar, to accommodate or 
make the yeere agree with 
the course of the Sun.   

Bitumen.  A kind of clay, 
naturally clamy like pitch; 
growing in some coun­
tries of Asia. It was of old 
used in Physick: The best 
is heavy, bright and cleere, 
of purple colour, and ha­
ving a strong smell. The 
black is accounted naught. 
This Bitumen was used in 
stead of morter, at the 
building of the tower of 
Babel, as appeareth in Gen. 
cap. 11. There is also a 
kind of Bitumen, like unto 
a liquor, flowing out of 
some fountains in the I­
land Sicilie, which is used 
in stead of oyle to burne

ly: others affirme it to be 
made of old lees of oyle, 
by art and drying in the 
Sun brought to be white; 
notwithstanding I suppose 
it rather to be a minerall.

(as I take it) be divi­
ded into three different 
kinds; namely, super­
naturall, naturall, and su­
perstitious Divination. 
Supernaturall Divination  



(onely revealed to man 
by God,) is not properly 
called. Divination, but 
prophecie, with which all 
the holy Prophets have in 
former times been inspi­
red. Naturall Divination 
may be divided into two 
branches; whereof the 
first is, that which hath 
in former times been pra­
ctised by wicked spirits in 
oracles and answers given 
by them in Idols, and is 
at this day sometime seene 
in possessed persons, who 
by suggestion of the devill 
may foretell often things 
to come: and this is but a 
naturall Divination: For 
although to us it seeme 
miraculous, because of our 
ignorance in the causes 
and course of things, yet in 
those spirits, it is but natu­
rall, who by their long ex­
perience, and great obser­
vation, beside the know­
ledge of secrets in nature, 
and their quicke intelli­
gence from all places, are 
able to foresee much more 
then we by nature can. 
The second branch of na­
turall Divination, is that 
which a wise man may 
foretell by probable con­
jecture, being no way of­
fensive, so long as it is on­
ly guided by reason, and 
overruled by submitting 
it selfe to the Almightie 
power of GOD. And 
to this second kind of 
Divination, may also A­
strologie bee referred 
(which by the motion 
and influence of Starres 
and Planets doth pro­
mise to foretell many 
things) so long as it kee­
peth it selfe in due limits, 
and arrogateth not too 
much to the certaintie 
thereof: into which ex­
cesse of vanitie if it should 
breake forth, it can then 
be no longer called na­
turall Divination, but 
superstitious and wicked: 
for the Starres may in­
cline, but not impose a 
necessitie in particular 
things. The third and 
last manner of Divinati­
on, is that which we cal­
led superstitious, where­
of there hath among the 
Gentiles been divers dif­
ferent kinds, namtly, Au­




guration.  Aruspicie, Necro­
mancie, Geomancie, Hydro­
mancie, Pyromancie, Cosci­
nomancie, Palmistrie or Chi­
romancie.  


Auguration, was a divi­
nation made of things to 
come, by the flying, fee­
ding, and chirping of birds: 
the professors whereof cal­
led Augurs, were of great 
account among the heathen 
Romans, in so much that 
there was a Colledge of 
them in the City; neither 
would the Romans under­
take any publike matter of 
importance, without asking 
their assent. But the vanity 
hereof was well derided by 
a wise Jew, named Mosso­
lamus;  as Josephus writes. 
For an Augur in the wars 
once requiring, that the 
army which was then mar­
ching, might stand still a 
while, till he tooke obser­
vation of a bird there by, 
to foreknow the successe of 
that expedition, this Jew 
whilst the Augur was bu­
sie in his art, shot at the 
Bird with an arrow, but 
by chance killed her: 
whereat the Augur and 
others being highly offen­
ded: Are you so foolish 
(quoth the Jew) to ima­
gine this poore Bird can 
tell what will happen to 
us, that could not foresee 
her owne death so neere 
at hand? Aruspicie is a 
divination, which by ope­
ning and viewing the bow­
els of beasts, did under­
take to foretell things to 
come: the professors 
whereof were called A­
ruspices. Necromancie,  the 
worst of all others, is 
that divination, which is 
practised by conjuration, 
and calling up Devils or 
dead mens Ghosts. Which 
manner of divination we 
read practised by King 
Saul (1. Reg. cap. 28.) 
when he required a Sor­
ceresse to call up the spirit 
of Samuel to him. Geo­
mancie, is a kind of divina­
tion practised by making 
prickes and lines in the 
earth; as the name in 
Greeke signifieth. So Hy­
dromancie,  is a divination 
made by some apparition 
in water, as Varro writeth, 
that a Boy saw in water,  



one bearing the forme of 
Mercury, who foretold in 
one hundred and fiftie 
verses, the event of the 
warre which the Ro­
manes had with King 
Mithridates. Pyromancie 
is a divination made by 
the fire, or spirits ap­
pearing in the fire. Cos­
tinomancie  is a ridiculous 
kind of divination made 
with a sieve; which at this 
day is used by some sim­
ple women, and appea­
reth to be of antiquitie, 
for in the third Idylle of 
Theocritus there is men­
tion made hereof. Palmi­
strie or Chiromancie, is 
a divination practised, by 
looking upon the lines of 
the fingers and hands, 
an art still in use, among 
fortune tellers, Egypti­
ans, and Juglers. Besides 
these there were also o­
ther divinations, as name­
ly Acromancie, that which 
is gathered by apparitions 
in the aire. Capnomancie, 
by the flying of smoake. 
Catoptromancie by visions 
shewne in a glasse. All 
which being even by the 
Pagans themselves ac­
counted deceitfull and 
vaine, it remaineth that of 
Christians they be utterly 
rejected and abhorred.   

Divorce. A separation of 
man and wife, which was 
(as our Saviour witnes­
seth) first permitted by 
Moses unto the Israelites, 
for the hardnesse of their 
hearts, that men might 
rather put their wives a­
way, whom they grew 
wearie of, than use them 
with too great extremitie, 
to shorten their lives, as 
many did. The woman so 
divorced was to have of 
her husband, a writing (as 
Josephus witnesseth) to this 
effect. I promise, that here­
after, I will lay no claime 
to thee: And this writing 
was called a bil of divorce. 
But with Christians this custome is abrogated, sa­
ving onely in case of a­
dulterie. The ancient 
Romanes also had a cu­
stome of divorce, and a­
mongst them, it was as 
lawfull for the wives to 
put away their husbands, 
as for the husband to dis­
 



misse his wife: but amongst 
the Israelites, this preroga­
tive was onely permitted 
to the husband.

tion among the people, 
that all controversies were 
referred to their determi­
nation, and a great penal­

flame like a candle. It is

ther then alwaies, but when she is in such a point, that 
the shadow of the earth de­
priveth her of the Sunne 
beames, from whence she 
taketh her light, Eclipse of 
the Sunne is not so usuall, 
and happeneth only at the 
change of the Moone, 
namely when the Moone 
being between the Sunne 
and us, doth with her dark 
body, hide part of her light 
from us: which was the 
cause that Dionysius Areopa­
gita, seeing the Sunne 
so admirably eclipsed at 
our Saviours Passion, con­
trarie to all reason, when 
the Moon was not in any 
neerenesse to hinder his 
light, cryed out in amaze­

rection. Or omit the second part (named the Minor) and say Every sinne deser­
veth correction, therefore every theft deserveth cor­
rection, Then it is called an Enthymeme, to wit, a keeping in the mind (for so the word properly sig­
nifieth) because one of these parts is understood in the mind: where note that if the two endes of the Enthymeme are like in speech, then the Minor is wanting, if the two beinnings be like, the Major is omitted, as may easily appeare by the fore­
going example.

waies so, that both those numbers exceed not the number of 30. For if they amount to above 30. the must you cast away the 30. and the remaining number shall be the Epact.

Note also: when in any yeere the E­

ding huge greatnesse, in the middle whereof, he erected an Idoll to Iupiter,  in the likenesse of a Ram; which Idol afterward gave Oracles, and was called the Oracle of Ammon; be­

mos, the seventh of Cu­
mae, a City of Campania in Italy. This Sibylla of Cumae, (as it is written) came on a time to Tarquine  King of Rome, in the ha­
bit of a str~age old woman, offering to sell him nine bookes, full (as she said) of divine oracles; for which she demanded three hun­
dred crownes of gold: the King not much regarding, and beside thinking them too deare at that price, she burned three of them be­
fore his face, and then as­
ked if he would have the other sixe, for which she demanded no lesse than she had don at first for the nin. Hereat the King de­
riding  



her and thinking her halfe mad, she burned three more of them, and told him that he should give her the same price for those three that were left. The King much wonder­
ing at the womans con­
stant earnestnesse, and therefore thinking the bookes contained no com­
mon matter, commanded three hundred crownes to be given her for them, which she receiving, pre­
sently vanished out of sight. These bookes were after kept by the Romans very carefully, who in great matters of doubt, alwayes had recourse to them, as to an assured ora­
cle. The eighth Sibyll  was called Sibylla of Helespon­
