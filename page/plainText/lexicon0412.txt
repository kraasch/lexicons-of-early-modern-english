Mothes and Cankers, who with their shallow inventions and silly
fancyes, must still be engrafting new coyned words in our English
nursery, without either art or judgement. I seeke not to discredit
their worthy and immortall labours, who with unmatchable industry,
have fetcht hither the best inhabitants of other climates, and made
them denizens in our Colonies: those who with a skilfull felicity have
bought, brought, or borrowed, the richest ornaments of other Lan­
guages to make ours abound with plenty, and variety; but those I
disclaime, who when the worke is excellently performed already, must
still be fingring; and when the Quintessence and life of other tongues
are ours already, must now trafficke for the dregges, to the end they
may be said to have done somewhat ....

How ridiculous if well considered is the merchandise they seeke to
 sell for currant,

Let me afford you a few examples, and I am deceived if they will
not move both your anger, and laughter, read and censure.

A thousand other so unnaturall phrases, that they cause a loathing
in a curious and judicious eye. These and such as these, that set up
mints for such base coyn would I have the Arts to persecute & not suf­
fer them to mix their counterfeit stuffe amongst our purer ingredients
so to canonize them for currant. Our Language is copious enough al­
ready, we need traffick no more to enrich it; at least not so oft, for
yet I will not deny, but some pearle or other may be left behinde
uncheapened by our former factors, which is worth the buying, yet
would I have it naturallized here with judgement, and authority.
