and some saye that Peper is made 
blacke with brennynge in the fyre 
for whan it is gathered there be a 
great multitude of serpentes about 
it, & therfore they put it in the fyre 
to brenne the serpentes that be about 
it, the Sarysyns drye it in an ouen 
bycause it shall nat encrese in an­
other lande. But of al the Pepers, 
the blacke is the beste and the most

grounde well dygged and turned 
aboue it with good donge, this sede 
wolde be sowen somewhat thycke 
and whan they be som what sprong 
take vp the greatest lekes & plante 
them in forowes, but take a waye 
none of theyr roote whan ye set them 
in the forowes, but whan ye set them 
wyth a dyble, than cutte a way the 
rotes almoste vp to the leke head & 
awaye the vppermost of the leues



they may be planted in Iulie, Au­

be much profitable in March, and 
in Apryll nexte folowynge, but in 
your plantynge you shall nat seke 
after fate softe ground for menely 
rounde that is beste & that grounde 
that is almoste drye is beste, there 
is two maner at settynge of lekes, 
one is in forowes, as is the maner 
in Bonony and the forowe muste 
be fro the other a spanne large, and 
the lekes mast be set in the forowe 
iiii. fyngers brede eche fro other, & 
whan ye make nexte forowe caste 
the earth on the lekes and treade it 
downe softely with thy fote. The 
ii. maner is thus whan the ground is 
well dygged & raked than make ho­
les with a great dyble & euery hole 
fro other a large span more in which 
the lekes must be set in, but fyl nat 
thy holes nor put earth on them but 
let them be voyde, iii. wekes whan we­



des growe amonge them pul them 
vp & kepe them clene fro wedes. Di­
uers auctours saye that the Lekes 
that be thus planted be better than 
any other, or they may be well plan­
ted amonge great onyons & whan 
the onyons be taken awaye, wede 
the leke and you shall fynde them 
fayre and good and whan ye plucke 
vp, leue some in a place, & leue som 
for sede, the whych sede may be kept 
iii. yere, and it be hanged vp in the 
hulles, Lekes be beste soden, or .iii. 
tymes wasshed before they be eaten. 
For a wounde take lekes and stam­
pe them wel with hony, and laye it

vse to drinke it, for the same take the ioy­
ce of lekes & medle it with womans 
mylke and vse to drinke it, & it wyl

set it in the sonne x. dayes and this 
oyle is good agaynste chafyng of

SImapum is called mustar­
de, it is hote and drie, in the 
medle of the .iii. degre, and nat the

cynes. Fyue yeare he maye be 
kepte in hys vertue. He hath ver­
tue losynge, of drawynge, of ma­
kynge thyne, and of consumynge. 
For the palsy of the tonge take and 
chewe the sede in your mouth, and 
holde it vnder the tonge and it shall 
do you good. Also for the Palsye 
in other membres sethe the sede in 
wyne and laye it to the sore place



and is beste in the begynnynge of 
the dysease. Also take the pouder of 
it, and put it into your nosethrilles 
and it will make you to nese and it 
clenseth the brayne and superfluite 
flume. Also sethe it in wine and fig­
ges & holde it warme in your mou­
the tyll it be al most colde than take 
as much and do so .v. or .vi. times 
a day asmuche another day & this 
is good for an olde pose of chough 
and flumy humour in the  head 
Also for stopping of the splen and 
the lyuer sethe the sede in water with 
rotes of Fenel, than strayne it and 
put therto hony and gyue it to the 
sicke to drinke. For hardnes of the 
splen sethe the herbe of it in wyne & 
playster it to the greuaunce for to 
rype and breke a postume, stampe 
thys herbe well with hogges grece 
and laye it to the postume. Also for 
Strangury take the herbe of thys



and sethe it in oyle and wyne and 
playster it to the greuance, and it 
wyll louse it. Also for the Ciatica
and for other olde sores take mu­
starde sede and the thyrde parte of 
crommes of white brede, and figges, 
hony, and vineger, after as the ach 
of the sore requyreth the more of the 
fygges and the hony that is there 
the more sharper is the strength of 
the sede, and the more bread and vi­
neger that is in it, the more weker 
is the sede, but I say nat that ye shall 
put thys confection to al sores but 
to great and olde sores. Hys vertu 
if yf he be eaten it sharpeth a man­
nes wyt, it clenseth the bely, it bre­
keth the stone it purgeth the vryne 
menstrosite, and comforteth the sto­
make.

¶ Smalage. 
Take Smalage sede Rewe sede, 
Peper and salte and grynde them

wyne and drynke it, for it is good 
for colde and wycked humours in

make the lyuer and the longes, it 
is good for woundes. For ranke­
lynge and to cease the brennynge

den Sage, for that consumeth more

dothe. For the palsy, sethe the leues 
of sage in wine & vse to drinke it. For 
the same sethe the leues in wine & plai­
ster it to the greuaunce, also it is good
