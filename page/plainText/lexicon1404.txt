LONDON: 
Printed by H. L. and R. B. for Thomas Basset at the George 
in Fleetstreet, near Cliffords Inne. 
M. DC. LXX.  




  

An EXPLANATION of several Words used in 
this History, as an Essay to the larger Dictionary of Metallick and Chymical Words, mentioned 
in the Preface.



A. 

ADit, what: see page 2.

"Now the Adit is from the Latine word Aditus, 
that is to say, an entry, passage, or approach to a thing. 
And this is usually made on the side of the Hill, 
but towards the bottom, about 4, 5, or 6 feet high, 
and 8 feet wide, in the nature of an Arch, 
sometimes cut in the rock, and sometimes supported 
with timber; so that the sole or bottom of this Adit 
may answer the bottom of the Shaft, but somewhat lower, 
so as the water may have a sufficient Current to pass away, 
which is exactly known by the ordinary ways of Dialing, 
or the Workmans keeping the water at his foot 
while there is any: and he is directed toward the Shaft 
by a Needle touch'd with a Loadstone, 
the using whereof is called Dialling: and by this and 
other Arts the water is conveyed away with more 
ease and less charge then by Pumps" (p. 2).

 

Adulterate,  adulterating. 

Adulteration, metaphorically 
used for the undue Mixtures of any thing 
which is prohibited by Law. 

Agriculture, tilling, dressing, or ma­
nuring Earth, whereby it may be 
better adorned with varieties. 

Alchimist, Alchimy. See Chemistry. 
p. 4. & 43. 

Alien, a stranger or foreiner, to alien, alienate, or fell to another, or stranger, 
from Alienus. 

Amber, Metallick or Electrum, com­
pounded of Gold and Silver, vide
Preface. 

Architecture, or the Art of building 
houses, &c. 

Arts Mechanical, vide p. 30, 31.

"the Seven Mechanical Arts, viz. Agriculture, Clothing, Navigation, Hunting, Architecture,
Medicine and Martial Discipline" (pp. 30-31).

 

Aspect, beholding or viewing; Aspect 
of Stars, is when certain Planets 
and Signs in Heaven do behold 
each other; and there are four 
such Aspects. 1. Trine. 2. Quar­
tile. 3. Sextile. 4. Opposite Aspect, 
viz. in Books of Astronomy.  
  

B.   
Barmote, vide Barr-master. 

Barr-Master or Barmer, and Burgh-Master, Barrmoote and Burgh­
moote; Moote here signifies a 
Court where the Matters in Con­
troversie are decided, and as Halli­
moote is called from Guild-Hall, 
where such Mootes are kept, and 
Burgh-Moote from such Burgs, Bo­
roughs or Towns where Courts 
are kept, so Barrmoote is only u­
sed for Miners, where they ap­
pear at a Barre, and he that gives 
the sentence as Superior is called 
the Barrmaster or Barmer, or Ru­
ler of that Barrmoote or Court for 
the Miners.

"Barmer" not found in OED.

 

Barrmine, such Mine as is adjudged 
at their Barmoote.

"Barrmine" not found in OED.

 

Bell-metall, how made. p. 4.

"Tin, Lead, Brass and Copper make that tunable metal
from which our Bells are founded, and the artificial 
mixture of these Metals may afford as many varieties 
as those do Changes" (pp. 4-5).

 

Bellows, such as blow the fire for 
melting Metals. 

Blocks, what, see p. 4. we give pieces 
of wood the same name, and they 
have an Analogie in respect of 
weight.

"when they are smelted and cast into a solid form, 
if Lead, they call them Pigs; if Tin, Blocks; 
if Iron, Bars; if Silver or Gold, Cakes; if Copper, 
Rose-cakes" (p. 4).

 

Boles or Bolestids, are places, where 
in ancient time, (before Smelting-­
Mills were invented) the Miners 
did fine their lead.

"Bolestids" not found in OED.

 

Bone-ashes, or bones burnt, and then 
beaten small, of which Tests are 
made, vide Tests. 

Botannists, such as deal in Plants. 

Brass, how made, see p. 4. The Latin 
is Æs, which is usually ap­
plied to Copper, but improperly; 
for Cuprum is Copper as a simple 
Metall, and Æs brass, a compound 
Metal of Copper and Lapis Cala­
minaris, and this word Brass ha­
ving no affinity with the Latin 
words Cuprum or Æs; it is pro­
bable that Composition was known 
before the Romans time, and so ne­
ver altered its name, and so of 
Gold and Silver. See Copper.

"Lapis Calaminaris" antedates the earliest OED citation (1696).

 

Boule, or dish, which is a certain 
measure, wherewith the Miner use 
to measure out the duties to the 
Church and King, reserved from 
the Oar as Tythe, containing a­
bout half a peck. 

Bullion, what: see pag. 40.

"And being thus formed in Ingots, Cakes or Dollers, they are usually in gross called Bullion" (p. 41).

 

Burghmaster, see Barmaster. 
 

 
Cakes, what, see p. 4. call'd so in re­
lation to their form round and 
flat, in part convex. 

Calefaction, calefying, or making 
warm.  

Cards, which are certain pieces of 
board, whereon wire is fixt, so as  



 
to kemb out wooll, and fit it for 
making of woollen clothes. And 
are sure Cards, Cards of labour 
and profit, not of pleasure and 
idleness. See Wire. 

Carriers. See p. 39.

"Besides these there are about 50. or 60. Carriers, 
according to the quantity of Oar; raised with horses, 
who usually carry two bags of Oar, containing 200. weight, 
which they deliver to the Clark imployed for that purpose, 
who is constantly to attend the bringing in thereof, 
who keeps several Tallies with such Carriers as brings the same, 
which Tallies (the Carriers being gone for more Oare) 
are fairly entered by him which keeps the Mill Book, 
by which the quantities are known, and from which works 
such Oar comes" (p. 39),

 

Cast-works: such Metals as are not 
Malleable, or apt to be beaten, by 
reason of their fragile or brittle 
nature, and are therefore cast in­
to Plates or formes fit to be cut 
into Wire, or other uses.

"Cast-works" not found in OED except in a citation for "cayuse," n. (1857).

 

Cephalicks, Cures of Diseases be­
longing to the head. p. 5. 

Chymistry, Chymick, Chymical, or Che­
mistry. The Art of separating 
Metals. See Alchimy. 

Cinders, the scum or refuse of Iron 
which is burnt. 

Circuit, Circuity, a compassing, or go­
ing about. 

Coale, 1. Black, such as is burnt or 
charkt. 2. White, which is only ba­
ked in an Oven to make it dry for 
fewell. 

Coelestial, things belonging to Hea­
ven, from Cœlum. 

Condensation, or being more hard or thick. 

Conflagration, when all things shall 
consume together, as at the last 
day of Judgement. 

Cope, from Copia plenty. See p. 89. 

Copper, consists most of sulphur, this 
is like to come from the Latin word Cuprum, and taught us by 
the Romans. See Brass. 

Cordials, things which comfort the 
Heart. p. 5. 

Cowes, are houses that the Miners 
build over their Groves, and not 
such as give milk; I suppose ra­
ther Coves Coverings.

"Cowes" not in OED in this sense, but apparently related to "cowl," n.1, 4.

 

Coyn, to coyne, coynage. p. 40. 42. 56.

"MEtall being thus Coyned or Minted, it is called Coyn 
from Cudere to forge, or from Communis, 
because it is then made common, or from the French word Coigne, 
which signifies a Corner, because most of the Coynes anciently 
were made with Angles, and some at this day in Spain and France.

Or it is more probable, Vorstigan makes King and Cuning Synonyma's, 
so may King, Cuning and Coyning; for his Regality is shewn by his Coyn, 
and to know the intrinsick value, use and allays fit for Coyn, 
shews his Cunning; for we use that word to express a subtilty, 
or exquisite knowledge of any Art or Science.

But the Romans had three names for Coyn; Pecunia 
from Pecora, Cattel; because men who abounded in Cattel 
were accounted rich, and call'd Pecuarii; and now those 
who abound in Coyn are called Pecuniosi; The other name 
they gave was Nummus from King Numa as 'tis conjectured, 
who first gave an Impression on them; or from Numero, 
and therefore when money was paid, they say, and so we in our Law, 
it was paid Pecuniis numeratis" P. 42).

 
  

D.   
Dyalling of Mines, what, see p. 2. 
which is done with the like Instru­
ments of Art, by which Sun-dials 
or surveighing of ground is per­
formed, p. 2. See G. Agricola. 

Discoverer, is any person who doth 
finde out a Metal or Mineral which 
was covered, and discovers or re­
veals it to the Proprietor of the 
ground, or to the Societies, &c. 

Domestick, or that which concerns 
business at home.
 

E.   
Effluxion, which flows from a thing 
as sweat from the body. 

Elixer. See Quintissence. 

Ens veneris. p. 5.

"From Copper is extracted Ens Veneris, so famous against Ulcers, &c." (p. 5).

the falling-sickness. p. 5. 

Eucharist, or the Sacrament of the 
Body and Blood of Christ. See 
Transubstantiation. 

Ewers, vide Ores. p. 57. 

Excression, that which grows natu­
rally, or by force of Art, out of 
any thing. 

Exhaustion, to exhaust, exhausting or 
drawing out. 

Extraction, or drawing by force, also 
to extract, Extractings. 

Extrinsick, or outward.


F. 
Fuell, or Materials wherewith to sup­
ply or continue fires, whether 
wood or any other combu­
stibles.  


G.   
Genuine, or natural, from Genus, its 
proper kinde. 

Gold, the most perfect of all Metals, 
it comes not from Aurum the La­
tin word, which shews the Romans 
had little use of it here, or it had a 
name with us before their Lan­
guage. 

Grove is the Pit that leads down to the Mine.

This sense of "grove" does not appear in OED, "grove," n.

 


H.   
Hypocondriacks, diseases relating to 
the spleen. p. 5. 

Hysterick Passions, such as the Disea­
ses called the Mother, Convulsi­
ons, &c.  
  

I.   
Incorporation, Corporation, Incorpora­
ting, are embodying several men 
into a joynt Company, or Society, 
for the carrying on some Affair, 
and the person so incorporated 
called a Corporators, or Incorpo­
rators.

"Corporator" antedates the earliest OED citation (1787). "Incorporator" antedates the earliest OED citation (1829). 

  



  
Ingotts, or silver melted into propor­
portions, fit to be cut into coyn.
 See p. 40. 

Intrinsick, or inward. 

Iron, seems to be a word which is 
more ancient then the Roman Lan­
guage, which terms it ferrum, un­
less ferrum be called Iron by way 
of Irony.  

  
L.   
Lattin, is brass coloured over with 
oare, it is only cast, and is too 
brittle to endure the hammer: 
How the word hath relation to the 
Roman Language is to be enqui­
red. 

Lead seems to be a word also with us 
more ancient then the Roman 
Language, which calls it Plum­
bum. 

Lessees, such as take Leases from o­
thers, or of any Mines from the 
Societies, with Covenants to work 
the same, and pay the Kings du­
ties, &c. 

Letters Pattents, Literæ Patentes, or 
Writing, sealed with the broad Seal 
of England, whereby men are au­
thorised to do or enjoy any thing, 
that otherwise of themselves they 
could not do; there are four sorts 
mentioned in this History: First, 
of the Mines Royal, p. 49. 54. 62 
Secondly, of the Society of the 
Mineral and Battry-works, p. 57. 
60, 65. Thirdly, of the Society of 
the Royal Company, p. 27. And 
fourthly, of the Royal Company, 
p. 17.

where the Composition of Metals 
binde together more firm. 

Liquidity, Liquidities, liquid or moist­
ning. 

  
M.

which is between the Center and 
the Surface of the Earth. 

Meere, 29 yards is a Meer in the low 
Peak, 31 in the high Peak, and the 
bredth is from skirt to skirt, in a 
rake or Pipe-work, and in a flat 
work.

"skirt" antedates the earliest (and only) OED citation in this sense ("skirt," n., 8b [1747]).

 

Metallists, such as deal in Me­
tals. 

Metals of seven sorts, vide Preface,

which are referred to the intended 
Dictionary of Metallicks, or per­
taining to Metals. 

Metals Artificial. p. 43. 

Mines, what. vide p. 1.

"A MINE is defined to be a certain Foramen, Hole, Hollow place, 
or Passage digged in the Earth, from whence Metals or Minerals 
are by labour raised: for if common Stones onely are found 
(as Marble, Touchstone, Freestone, &c.) we call them Quarries, 
and not Mines. And where Clays are digged (as Fullers earth, 
Potters earth, &c.) we call them Pits. Libavius terms it the Womb; 
or Natures place of Metals" (p. 1).

 

Mine Royal, and poor-Mine, vide p 9. 
& 52.

"WHere the Oar which is digged from any Mine doth not yield, 
according to the Rules of Art, so much Gold or Silver, 
as that the value thereof doth exceed the charge of Refining, 
and loss of the baser Metal wherein it is contained, 
or from whence it is extracted, then it is called 
poor Oar or a poor Mine.

On the contrary; where the Oar digged from any Mine 
doth yield according to the Rules of Art so much Gold or Silver, 
as that the value thereof exceed the charges of Refining, 
and loss of the baser Metal in which it is contained, 
and from whence it is extracted, then it is called rich Oar 
or a Mine Royal; 'tis appertaining to the KING by his Prerogative" (p. 9).

"poor-Mine" not found in OED.

which we English Money, and St. Austin says it was derived from Monere, 
to admonish, and as it were to warn us, that all our disposals of it, 
should be Honest, Just, Honourable, and to Charitable Ends" (p. 43).

 

Multiplication of Coyn, see p. 43.

or adding greater Allay then the Standard allows, or by clipping, 
or otherwise lessening their due weight and proportions" (p. 43).

 

  
N. 
Needle, a piece of Iron fixt on a Cen­

nary course of the common law, in 
right of his Crown, wherein he 
is only subject to God 

Proprietor, he who hath the property 
or right of the soil, wherein a Mine 
lies hid, or discovered. 

  
Q.   
Quarry, what, vid. p 1. 

Quick-Silver, seems to be a word 
used by us more ancient then the 
Roman language, which calls it 
Argentum Vivum, or Living Silver, 
which we call quick by reason of 
its nimble and active power, and 
therefore by some called Mercury. 
See Silver. 

Quintescence, Elixir, or the Philoso­
phers Stone, is a 5th spirit that 
doth tie the spirits of the four Ele­
ments together, and as the four 
Elements are in some proportions 
in all bodies, so is this spirit, and 
it is the Art of the Philosopher to 
extract this spirit out of any body, 
and that 5th. spirit which they ex­
tract out of Mettalls is this Quin­
tescence, or five spirits, by which 
such Miracles are to be effected, 
vid. p 44, 45. See Elixir.

dency is to be understood double 
that brightness, and so in other 
words, where the addition of Re, 
guides the word.

Shade, or glittering Earth, being as it 
were the shadow of a greater light. 

Shafts, what, see p 2. 

Silver, begotten of Quicksilver and 
Sulphur, it comes not from Ar­
gentum, the Lattin word, which 
shews it was not in use before the 
Romans, or at least had that name 
before them. See Quick-silver. 

Slaggs, is the dross remaining after 
melting or refining Lead, &c. 

Smelt, or Melt, thence a Smelter or 
Melter. 

Specimen, a proof or example. 

Speculation, speculating or beholding 
thing as in a glass face to face,

Standard, Money according to the 
Standard, is that which the State 
doth allow to be the mixture, as if 
10 parts of Silver and 2 of Copper 
12 d. or more or less as the State 
please to decree: The word is also 
used in martial affairs, as the Kings 
Standard, which carries his Co­

 



 
lours, as money doth, his Super­
scription. 

Stampers, such as beat the Oar small 
and fit for the Washers. 

Steel, natural and artificial, see p. 4 
and hath no affinity with the Latin 
word chalybs. 

Stow, to stow is to set pieces of wood 
upon the Grove or Pit, or the 
place where the Miners do intend 
to make a Pit, so as to lay a turn-­
tree and rope, whereby to 
draw Earth or Myne out of the 
Grove. 

Subterranean, that which is in and 
under the Earth, and under the sur­
face thereof. 

Superficies or Surface, that which 
appears first to the eye of a thing 
represented unto it. 

Swords, whereby is here to be under­
stood somewhat belonging to the 
Bellows, and not weapons offen­
sive or defensive, or rather Soards 
from Soare, or the arising and de­

Touch, from Touchstone, upon which 
if Gold or Silver be rub'd, the 
true is more easily distinguished 
from the false. 

Transubstantiate, or Transubstantia­
tion, or Transubstantiating, is to 
alter the substance of a thing, or 
transfer it from one substance to 
another, as making Gold of Sil­
ver, &c. See p. 44. and Eucha­
rist.

"Transubstantiating" antedates the earliest OED citation (1800).

 

Tun is 20 hundred weight, or four 
Hogsheads, or 12 score and 12 
Gallons. 


V.   
Veins of Metal, see p. 2.

"And when the Miners by these Shafts or Adits do strike 
or threed a Vein of any Metal (for Metals under the Earth 
are dispersed like Veins in our bodies, and therefore 
called Veins) then the Metal which is digged from those Veins 
is called Oar, as Silver oar, Lead oar, &c." (p. 2)."

 

Virgula Divina, see the Preface. 

Vocabulary, a recital of words.

longing to any trade. 


W.   
Wash, the Metallists usually, when 
their oar is stampt small, do put it 
 into a sieve, and poure water on 
it, which washes the durt from the 
Oar. 

Winlace, or an Engine to winde up 
weights, or any thing else with­
al.  

Wier, there is a Prohibition of forein 
wire in the fourth of Edw. the 
fourth, and in the 29. of Eliz. and 
other Statutes; but I finde not in 
any of our Dictionaries, English 
or Latin, the word Wire, but in 
the Italian, (who use no W. S. it is 
virare, to veer, or vertere, to 
turn, or draw any thing round, 
and so is Wire, and the French call 
the drawing of Wire, Tirare, T and 
V, being the same in their dialect, so 
that Vier or Wire intends the same 
thing, and Walton in all his Tran­
slations of the 7 Oriental Tongus, 
calls Wire only silum, and Jun. & 
Tremel. filamentum, or Metal 
drawn out like a Thred, from 
whence we call small wire, 
thread of Wyer. The reason 
of prohibiting forein wier, 
is because it is so weak and 
flexible, that it doth not kemb  



  
the wool as it ought to be, where­
as English wire is strong and 
more fit for that purpose, and 
these wiers are framed with pie­
ces of flat boards, which are cal­
led Cards. See Cards. 

Woughs, or Wall of the Groves.


Y. 
Yoaked, is to set pieces of Wood 
joyned together within. the 
Grove, to prevent the Earth 
falling.
